After I bought monster cable connection pedal, I thought I should try another one and update my guitar. I've been using the high-end Planet Waves cable I bought in the 1980s... I was a little disappointed when I found that the input jack on the new Monster Cable did not match the FENDER STRAT Jack... I didn't return it, as mentioned earlier, I used it for the output on the pedal. Save money... I went back to my planetary wave cable... In the 1980s, I paid $30 for planetary waves.

First, the'tuner'issues I've been reading about. Replace the strings! I stretched these things out and they didn't keep up. A series of D'Addario 10's has immediately cured this (or whatever you prefer, just change it). The tuners aren't the best, but it's not their fault, it's the cheap strings. Well, technically, if you only play open chords, it's playable from the box. The neck angle was so out of line A, no matter how high I put the bridge. The guitar wouldn't fit him because of the ridiculous angle. Yeah, I could have sent it back, but I guess I could have gotten another one like him. I had to spend about six hours swinging the neck AND the nut (I never had to do that with the nut on an electric guitar, not even on a used guitar. The nut tree was too deep cut), as well as working to level almost all the handles to make it playable. It took three business cards to swing my neck, which is most of what I've ever had to use. After I just got this, I removed some color from my neck and put wood glue in my bag and on all screws. In my opinion, this is very helpful for these and all the bolts in this matter. If I had bought this, it wouldn't have been a big deal. But while I'm looking at this horrible neck angle and doing all this work, I'm constantly staring at the QC sticker. Must have been built on Friday afternoon or something. Now that I've done that, it's sweet!! I play a Peavey Valveking 100 and it rocks as well as my Strat w/Duncans and Dimarzios. The quality of electronics is not sub par at all. After adjusting t he pickups screws to the strings height an d getting all the horrible growth from them, I would argue that this is as good a t as any epi I've ever played as far as puppies and everything, so don't hesitate there because I'm really not interested in Epis and I'm in love with her.

First, the melody issues I've read. Replace the threads! I got tired and stretched these things and they didn't stay in tune. A D'Addario 10 set healed it immediately (or whatever you prefer just change it). Musicians aren't the best, but it's not the fault, it's the cheap strings. Now, technically, if you only played open chords that was easy to play from the box. The angle of the neck was as far away from the A-string it shook as high as I put the bridge. The guitar wouldn't talk because of the ridiculous angle. Yeah, I could have sent it back, but I suspect I'd have gotten another one of these. It took me about six hours to twist my neck and my junk. (I never had to do that in the electric box, not even on a used guitar. The crack for the dummies was cut too deep) It took three business cards to slit my throat, which is the longest I've ever had to pay for it, and it took a lot of money. After I realized it, I removed some color from the neck and put it with wood glue in my pocket and all the screws. In my opinion, this helps a lot with these and everything else. But as I look at this horrible corner of my neck and do all this work, I keep staring at the ""QC Pass"" sticker. I'm playing through a Peavey Valveking 100 and it's as good as my Strat w/Duncan and Dimarzios. The quality of the electricity. I'm playing through a Peavey Valveking 100 and it's as good as my Strat w/Duncan and Dimarzios. Since we adjusted the screws to match the height of the strings and took all the awful candle off them, I'd say that's so good. As much adrenaline as I've ever played as puppies and everything, so don't hesitate there, because I'm not really interested in Epis and I'm in love with it. If you can work guitar, do it. Otherwise I would recommend a more expensive model. The $299 models are perfect than the box usually.",3
151,"I'll know soon. I want to take it out of the box and give it five stars only for its value. I still shook my head and didn't believe I bought the guitar at this price. First of all, I have been reading about the ""adjustment period"". Change the rope! I elongate these things. They are not suitable for photography. 10 sets of d'adario can solve this problem. The adjustment period is not the best, but they should not be blamed. This is a cheap string. In terms of current technology, if you only play the open code, you can open the box and use it directly. The angle of the neck is too far. No matter how high I put my leg, the rope squeaks. Because of the ridiculous angle, the guitar can't make sound. Yes, I could have sent it back, but I doubt I can get something different from it. It took me about six hours to put cushions on the piano wood and nuts. (electric guitars don't even need to do this on used guitars. The nut groove is cut too deep.) Moreover, I try to calm almost all my troubles. It needs three business cards to fill its throat. This is the most business card I have ever used. After straightening it, I took a little paint from my neck and rubbed the pockets and all the screws. In my opinion, this is very helpful to solve these problems and the connection of all bolts. If you buy what I used, these are not great. But looking at this terrible target angle, when doing all this, I saw the label of ""passing QC"". It must have been built on Friday afternoon or when. Now, after I do this, I feel good!!! I've sat in Peavey valving 100, and his rock effect is as good as my strat w / Duncan and dimarzios. The quality of electronic products is not bad at all. I think this is the same as any EPI I've ever played. It adjusts the height of the string by adjusting the screw of the pickup and removes all the terrible wax. Because I really don't like EPI, I like it very much. (song Yijing (Shen Zhixian): I bought it mainly to sell it. Now???) Building quality Well, if you can play the guitar, let's go. Otherwise, more expensive models are strongly recommended. Models priced at $299 can usually be used as soon as the box is opened.",3

They are so fresh that they can't even tell you how many strings their instrument has! The Chinese pedal just can't be broken. Maybe once, but not today, it has not reached the standard for a long time. As a young player, I insist on having a Chinese pedal. My mother bought this for me. I think it's great until I learn better. It took me about a week to learn how to open it. When I finally opened it, I thought I broke it! The EQ of this pedal is not good. There is no smooth transition from heel to toe. There is a big drop in frequency, which stifles the effect. You must twitch your feet quickly to avoid falling. You have to push it forward, then step on it to open it, and then follow the same steps to close it. It is very inconvenient for people trying to move quickly between effects on the board. I can't say it's just a complete garbage. It does give you a gorgeous effect. It's a classic pedal, but now it's better. So why do we still stay in the stone age and this thing? I even had someone modify my, although it gave it more space and fixed the falling problem, I still had to hit it to turn it on / off, it still sounded like a cheap Hua. My suggestion? Mark tremontiva is great! Kick this thing at the end, it involves scope and simple use! This may cost more money, but you may eventually hate this crying child and get one, so start with Tremonti power Wah. I use DIGITECH rp250 processor for Wah. You might say it's a cheap processor, but I've used it for many years. I haven't seen anyone judge its price according to sound quality. That's the most important thing. Why I suggest using it for Wah is because you can control sensitivity. You have to press your toes down to open it (my setting is quite light). You can easily shape your tone on the blackboard. You even have presets (crybeab is one of them), and you can get a complete processor effect and a terrible wow a little more. If you want a cheap children's toy, this is for you.

Why I suggest using it with Hua, because you can control the sensitivity, you have to open it by pressing your toes (my setting is quite light), and you can easily shape your tone on the blackboard. You even have presets (including crybeab), and you can get a complete, more terrible processor effect. If you want a cheap children's toy, it's for you. Do you want to take something seriously?

I had someone to have a mod mine, and I still had to ride it still to turn it on / off while it repaired the falling problem, giving me a little more headlights. My suggestion?

The unique features on the dial can greatly change the sound you play, especially when playing chords. Everything is much more obvious. In my opinion, this is not necessarily a good thing. Playing a clean electronic organ (picking notes or plucking strings) is especially bad. If someone asks me if these are good choices, my answer is &#34; As the case may be &#34; Really, in my opinion, it depends on what you're playing. From a rhythmic point of view, I don't like these at all - they take away the warmth of the chord, because the tip of the plucked chord makes me feel that the plucked chord sounds too boring. For leadership, they can, because you can really study every note and let it pass. Can I play faster? No, can I lick it with an amazing lick that my normal choice can't do? No, I tried, but I didn't like it. Maybe if you often play a lot of protagonists, this is your way out. I didn't, and they weren't for me.

Now you can use this type of humidifier to increase humidity, but I think you really need a complete internal solution and monitoring system.

772,"Regardless of the string itself, I adhere to honest advertising and marketing. So when I seriously considered ordering this line, I read the summary. Among them, ""the immortal drug line is coated in a unique way to protect the wound line from DNA and other pollutants."" Yes. Oh, watch out for DNA to protect my rope! Yes, that DNA really messed up the guitar line In fact, this is the most serious pollutant in history. Even worse than the oil and mountains of our skin. DNA is the blueprint of these cells and is contained deep in the protective wall, so it is worse than the cell itself that includes and maintains DNA. But somehow, that nasty old DNA leak polluted our guitar line! Really? Musicians don't seem to have heard biology class? When I read the comments, I was like a marketing publicity, understanding the comments again and again. I found that none of these comments indicated that they actually bought the product at Amazon. well. The first honest comment I found was ""these counties sound a little hypocritical."" yes. Ah, the last is the real comment. You see, this product may or may not be good. It's probably the best county ever. But do I have to spend time and money testing strings? If there is no false marketing speculation, the string will certainly not be able to maintain its own quality. We are musicians, not fools. If you let us buy a rope, be completely honest in the market. High quality strings will sell well with performance, sound quality and longevity. No matter how big the market is, if the string is not good, you can only sell one set. If you like. You don't have to hype. Edit follow up: after reading a lot of comments, this is really a good string. This means that the product can be independent of the customer's testimony and does not need to be resold. ”。“",3

781,"I'm reluctant to write this comment because it's obvious that almost everyone likes these strings. To be honest, I was very impressed by their feelings and handling. I do think they are the best strings I have ever used for pure playability. Don't do it. It can't be better. They are smooth butter, very suitable for flat picking. But for me, it's a compromise, because I don't like the tone at all. I even spent time trying on three different guitars (all fearless guitars): the classic Maple edge / spruce top, Redwood back / edge with spruce top, and maple back / edge with NATO top. In all three cases, I don't like the tone as much as the strings I use. I really want to like them, but they don't have the timbre of the mid-range Martin SPS I usually use. This is not to say that they are not very good strings and sound different on other people's guitars, but I just don't like them on my guitar. I like to use rich bass and loud treble to provide a good projection effect for the folk and traditional music I play in our jam band. The elixir of immortality just lacks the powerful treble of the Martin string I use. The treble sounds small, not the clear Martin sound I usually use. To be fair, the bass string sounds great and no different. I have to say, depending on how you will use the string, choose the string carefully. I play in the acoustic group. The elixir strings have nothing I need to hear, even though they feel wonderful under your fingers. If playability is more important than great range, be sure to buy these strings... You won't be disappointed. I guess these will be good in sound and electricity. Electronic devices can compensate for the weaker treble.",3

This is not to say that they are not wonderful strings that make different sounds on the guitar of other people, but I just didn't like them on me. I love good projection with rich bass tones and ringing sounds for ethnic and traditional music I play in jam groups. Elixir just lacks high tones like Martin string punches I use, and I usually use Martin's tint ring tinble sound tinny sound. To be fair, the bass strings are loud and not very different. I need to say carefully to select a string based on how you use them. I play in an acoustic group and the Ericsson strings just don't have what I need to hear, even though they feel under your fingers.

Instead, I got a pretty good set of. 10, which lasted for a whole hour, and then d snapped on the neck pickup. I use PRS with Wilkinson bridge. It rarely breaks strings. I gently but completely pre stretch them. In addition, due to vocals and breaks, I lower it to EB, so I rarely break the normal string, Slinky 10。 Therefore, it is not acceptable to disconnect from the thick string for one hour at the minimum tension, especially when the price of these strings is three times that of most other electric strings. As for the timbre, it must be bright, almost avant-garde, but it's beautiful on the whole. However, after playing loudly with the drummer for about eight hours, I noticed a negative effect that these things seem to vibrate more than most strings, making them more difficult to tune. It sounds strange, I know, but when I replaced d with a small D (please note that the replacement single is not cheap, and the price is three times the original), I noticed that it is faster and narrower than the immortal medicine string. Therefore, I must say that so far, I have no impression of the electric string of the elixir of immortality. If the rope breaks quickly, what's the advantage of keeping it for a long time? Especially when its price is three times the original? What's the matter with tuning? Anyway, why does it cost so much? Is a thin layer of silicon really worth two dollars more per rope? Not when the rope is roasted in 50 minutes, no doubt. Anyway, I now have five kinds of elixir and one kind of elixir on my main axe, so as they age, I will have a good feeling about the tone and tone of elixir. I will report here later. As like as two peas, this song sounds almost the same as the tone of the ever young medicine. There are so many tones of the magic elixir of immortality. Don't get me wrong, I really want to like these, because I hate changing strings, but God, guys, how about quality control? If I have to pay three times the price, is it crazy to expect three times the quality? Or hell, even if it's just a little better... PS if you look at Dario's comments (I like their original music), they will answer a lot of comments and questions. I hope the elixir of immortality will do the same here and solve my problem. [editor: now, after playing on that guitar for six hours, string B and string D play in the same place. I ask again: if the string breaks three times faster, what's the use of a string with ""three times better sound"" [editor: 10 / 31 / 12. Please! In four hours, the a string will break. I only play once or twice a week ax, and next time I joke with the drummer, ""which one will go today?"" He said he was surprised that g was still playing, because he was also playing, and knew that g was the most nervous. An hour later, guess what? Yes. So there were four broken strings in less than 20 hours. Seriously? This is not only not a good price of $9, but I would be disappointed if it costs $3. The only bonus I can think of now is that they sound like when they play Good, new, but damn it, unless you play completely fluent jazz or similar music, I'll choose slinks or d'addarios. Unless I have a ""bad routine"", which seems to be three times lower than the normal price. Anyway, these elixirs are not worth the money.] [editor, March 3, 2013: I called elixir and told them about the multiple damage, and they sent me another set.

I stretch the rope gently but completely. In addition, due to the sound and fracture, I lower to EB, so I rarely break the normal string and slim. 10. Therefore, it is not acceptable to disconnect the thick rope for one hour at the minimum voltage, especially if the cost of these ropes is three times that of most other wires. As for the tone, it must be bright, almost avant-garde, but generally very beautiful.

It sounds strange, I know, but when I replace d with a small D (note that a simple replacement is not cheap, and the price is three times the original), I notice that it is faster and narrower than the elixir. So, I must say, so far, I haven't felt the wire of the elixir of immortality. If the rope breaks soon, why put it long? Especially if the price is three times the original? What happened to the deal? Anyway, why spend so much money? Is a thin layer of silicon really worth two dollars per rope? There is no doubt that when the rope is cooked in 50 minutes, it won't. Anyway, there are five kinds of elixir and one kind of elixir on my main axe. With their aging, I have a good feeling about the tone and tone of elixir and will be back in a minute.

It sounds good when they play new music, but for God's sake, unless you play completely smooth jazz or something like that, I'll choose slinks or addarios. It looks three times cheaper than usual. Anyway, these elixirs are not worth the price.] [editor, 03 / 03 / 2013: I called elixir and told them about many breakups, and they sent me another one.

815,"After all these reviews I've anticipated the best string ever. And the golden chain of glory that follows the years with the perfection of glittering sound! Instead, I continued for an hour before D snapped at the neck pickup. Got a decent set of the decade. I use PRs in Wilkinson bridge which almost breaks the string and I stretch them completely but completely. Furthermore, I tune to EB for voice and damage reasons, so I break the very few of my usual strings. As for tone, it is certainly bright and almost too dense, but zingy clean said all. But one denial I noticed after playing loudly at about 8 hour drummers is that these things seem to be vibrating louder than most strings. Strange sound, I know, but I don't think it's cheap either in a smooth price and a triple price (replacing d), I've noticed it's faster and faster tuning than Ericsson strings. So I have to say that I have never been so impressive about elixir's electric strings. If it breaks quickly, what is the good one of the string that lasts for a long time? Especially if it costs 3 times? And what is tuning? And why do these sacrifice so much? Is a micro thin coating of really worth silicone's of two dollars extra each string? If the string is not toast in 50 minutes, zero is suspected there. Anyway, I now have five elixirs and one smooth one of my main axe, so as they age, I get a good feeling to how elixir stays in tune or keeps their tone and I report here for a while. And its cynical D sounds almost exactly like elixir. So much for magic elixir tone. I don't get wrong, I really hate to change strings, but want to love these, Gez man, some quality management methods? If I'm going to pay a triple price, is it crazy to expect triple quality? Or heck, as well as a little. If PS sees the d 'Addario review (I love their acoustic strings), they respond to a lot of reviews and questions. I hope elixir does the same thing here and tackles my question. [edit: now 6 hours playing] on that guitar, the B string pop in the same place as D, neck pickup edited: 10 / 31 / 12. After 4 hours a string went. I only do one or two sessions a week and then I joke to the drummer I know he's gonna be g and so I know G is the most strenuous If you make a completely smooth jazz or some such thing, I stick to Slinkies or D daddalia. This set interrupted the hard rock session for four hours, but there was no problem with tuning",3
816,"After all these comments, I hope the best string in history, golden brilliance, will last for a whole year and the timbre will be brilliant! Instead, I got a pretty good suit. 10, lasted for a whole hour, and then d patted the skin of my neck. I used PRS with the Wilkinson bridge with little interruption, and I stretched gently but completely in advance. In addition, due to people and tears, I move to EB, so I rarely cut off the normal string, Slinky. 10. Therefore, it is unacceptable to disconnect from thick strings for one hour under minimum tension, especially if the price of these strings is three times that of most other strings. In terms of timbre, of course, it is light color, almost avant-garde, but on the whole, it is very beautiful. However, after playing loudly with the drummers for about eight hours, I noticed the negative effects of these things that seemed more vibrational, More difficult to adapt than most strings. It sounds strange, I know, but when I changed D (note that the replacement singularity is not cheap, the price is three times the original), I noticed that it is faster and narrower, Bigger than that long old string. Therefore, I must say that so far, I have no impression of strings. Strings are not old medicine. If the rope breaks quickly, what good is it to keep it for a long time? Especially when the price is three times the original? What happened to the settings? Anyway, why spend so much money? Does a layer of silicate really cost two yuan a rope? When the rope is baked in 50 minutes, it will not be ready, no doubt. Anyway, I now have five tablets that are not out of date, and the oldest one on my master axe, So as I grow older, I will have a good hunch about how they will reflect and reflect. I will report here later. By the way, this song sounds almost like a song about immature drugs. Magic had so many voices long ago. Don't get me wrong, I really want to like it because I'm tired of changing strings, but God, guys, how about quality control? If I pay three times the price, can I expect three times the quality to be crazy? Or, damn it, better If you read Dario's comments (I like their original music), they will answer a lot of comments and questions.

Let me ask again: what's the use if the string breaks three times faster? [editor: 10 / 31 / 12. In four hours, the a string will break. I only play on ax once or twice a week. Next time I joke with the drummer, I'll say, ""who will be today?"" He said that he was surprised that g was still playing, because he was also playing. He knew that g was the most nervous. Guess what in an hour? Yes. So in less than 20 hours, there were 4 SL left Really? It's not just a good price of $9. I'll be disappointed if I spend $3. The only thing I can think of now is that they sound good when I spend $3. If you don't play completely free jazz or similar music, I'll choose slinks or adrios. If I'm not ""bad"" Route, which seems to be three times the normal price. In any case, these stale drugs are not worth the money at all. [editor, March 3, 2013: I called the elixir and told them there were many injuries, and they sent me another set. It took four hours without rest, but considering that I had tried it EMA adaptation still exists. I will serve good customers and add a star. I hope my first set can be unexploded. There is no mute at all.",3
817,"After all those reviews, I expected the Greatest Strings One, gold strings from Gloria that would last a year with sparkling tonal perfection! Instead, I got a decent set of them. Ten that took an hour before the D snapped on the neck pick up. I use a PRS with a Wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings, and I preach them carefully but completely. Plus I tune to Eb for vocal and breakable reasons, so I break very little of my normal strings, Slinky. 10's. Therefore, a break in an hour of a thick string under minimal tension, adjusted, is unacceptable, especially when these strings cost three times as much as most other electrical strings. As for the tone, it's certainly clear and almost too sharp, but nicely said all. However, after eight hours of playing hard with a drummer, I noticed that these things vibrate much more than most strings, making them harder to vote. It sounds strange, I know, but when I replaced the D with a Slinky D (replacing singles is also not cheap at three times the price, mind you), I noticed that it is faster and in a tighter range than the Elixir strings. So, I have to say, I'm not impressed with Elixir's electrical strings so far. What's the point of a long rope if it breaks fast? Especially if it costs three times more? And what about that tuning thing? And why do these actually cost so much more? Is a layer of silicone stuff really worth two extra dollars for each string? Not if that string is roasted in fifty minutes, no doubt there. Anyway, I've got five Elixirs and a Slinky on my head right now, so when they get older, I get a good feeling about how the Elixirs stay in harmony and hold their tone, and I'll report back here in a while. And by the way, that Slinky D sounds almost exactly like the Elixirs, tonal. So much for the Magic Elixir Tone. Don't get me wrong, I really want to love these, because I hate changing strings, but guys, how about some quality control? If I pay triple the price, is it crazy to expect me to triple the quality? Or even a little better... PS If you look at the D'Addario reviews (I like their acoustic strings), they respond to many of the reviews and questions. I hope Elixir will do the same here and answer my questions. [Edit: And now, after only six hours of playing on that guitar, the B string came to the same place as the D, neck pick-up. Again I ask: what is good about strings that ""sound three times longer"" if they break three times faster?] [Edit: 10/31/12. Come on! After four hours the A string went. I only play that axe one or two sessions a week, and the next time I joked to the drummer, ""Which one goes today?"" He said d that he's surprised that the G is still on, because he also plays and knows that the G takes the most tension. An hour later, guess what? Yeah. So that's four broken strings in less than twenty hours to play. Seriously? new, but dang, unless you're playing fully flowing jazz or something, I would stay at Slinkies or D'Addarios. Unless I play have a ""bad set"", which seems a little faint for a triple normal price. Anyway, these Elixirs were just not worth the money.] [Edit, 3/3/13: I called Elixir and told them about the multiple fracture, and they sent me another set. That set has taken a few hours hard rock sessions without pause yet, thought the tuning issue remains. I will add a star for a good customer service and hope that maybe my first set was a blindness. But honestly said, at this price, there should be no push at all.]",3
818,"After all these reviews, I expected the Greatest Strings Ever, golden strands of glory that would last a year with sparkling tonal perfection! Instead, I got a decent amount. Ten, which took an hour before the D broke on the pickup. I use a PRS with a Wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks the threads, and I stretch them gently but completely. Besides, I'm shutting down Eb for vocal and bridge reasons, so I'm breaking very few of my normal strings, Slinky. 10's. Ergo, a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal voltage, is unacceptable, especially if these strings cost three times as much as most other electric strings. As for the sound, it's definitely bright and almost too nervous, but nicely chitchat everything. One negative I noticed after about eight hours of loud playing with a drummer is that these things vibrate far more than most strings, making them harder to tune. It sounds strange, I know, but when I replaced the D with a Slinky D (replacing singles is also not cheap to triple the price, please note), I have since noticed that it tunes faster and in a narrower range than the Elixir strings. So I have to say, I've never been impressed with elixir-electric strings before. What's the good in a long rope if it breaks fast? Especially if it costs three times more? And what about the tuning? And why does that cost so much more? Is a micro-thin coating of silicone really worth two dollars a string? Not if the string is toast in fifty minutes, no doubt. Anyway, I've got five elixirs and a Slinky on my main axis now, so when they get older, I'm gonna get a good feeling about how the elixirs keep up and keep their tone, and I'll be right back here. And by the way, Slinky D sounds almost exactly like the elixirs, audibly. So much for Magic Elixier Tone. Don't get me wrong, I really want to love them because I hate to change the threads, but how about a quality check? If I want to triple the price, is it crazy to expect the quality to triple?

Seriously? new, but if you don't play smooth jazz or something, I would stay at Slinkies or D'Addarios Unless I have a ""bad sentence"" that seems pretty lame for three times the normal price. Anyway, these elixirs were just not worth the money.] [Edit, 3/3/13: I called Elixir and told them about the multiple fractures, and they sent me another sentence. This sentence took a couple of four hours of hard rock sessions without breaks, thought the tuning problem would remain.

819,"After all these reviews, I expected Gloria's biggest strings to last for a year with brilliant tonic perfection! Instead, I got a decent set of ten that lasted an hour before the D broke in the pickup neck. I'm using a PRS with a Wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings, and tends them softly but completely. Also, I can't connect to Abe for vocal and interruption reasons, so I'm breaking very few of my normal strings, Slinky.10. Therefore, a break in an hour from a thick string under minimal tension is unacceptable, Especially when these strings cost three times more than all the other electric strings. As for the tuna, it's certainly bright and almost too extreme, but politely zingy all said. However, one negative I've noticed after about eight hours playing loud with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings, making it harder to coordinate. It sounds strange, I know, but when I replaced D with a Slinky D (replacing singles isn't cheap or triple-priced, please note) I've noticed since then that it's racing faster and narrower than the Elixir strings. So, I have to say, I'm not impressed with the Elixir electric cords so far. What good is a long time if it breaks fast? Especially when it costs three times more? And what about the coordination issue? And why do these cost so much more? Is a tiny silicone coating really worth two extra dollars each string?

The only plus I can think of at this point is And it sounded good when it was New, but if you didn't play loose jazz or something, I'd stay with Slinky or D'Addarios. In any case, these Elixirs weren't worth the money. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry. [Edit, 3/3/13: I called Elixir and told them about the multiple fracture, and they sent me another set.

820,"After all these comments, I look forward to the best string and golden thread glory in history for a year, and the sound will flicker perfectly! But I got a very good 10 penalty. It lasted an hour. Moreover, d made a snap on the leather card around his neck. I used a PRS with Wilkinson bridge. Although I was light, I was completely ahead of schedule. In addition, due to the human voice and disconnection, I dropped to EB, so I rarely cut off the normal string. Slinky. Therefore, it is unacceptable to cut and lower the thick string within 1 hour under the minimum tension. In particular, the price in this county is three times that in most other counties. For the timbre, it must be bright. It's near avant-garde, but it's beautiful on the whole. But after playing loudly with drummers for about 8 hours, I found that these things vibrated more and uncoordinated than most counties. That sounds strange I already knew. But I changed to little D (it's not cheap to change a single. The price is three times the original.) It is faster and narrower than the immortal medicine Xian So I want to say that I don't remember the whole county of elixir. If the rope breaks quickly and can last for a long time, what's the advantage? Especially when its price is three times the original? What is harmony? Anyway, why do these things cost so much? Is a thin layer of silicon really worth two dollars more for a rope? When the rope matures in 50 minutes, there is no doubt. In short, I now put five kinds of longevity medicine and one kind of longevity medicine on the main axe Therefore, as they age, they will feel good about the tunes and tunes of longevity drugs. Report here later On the other hand, this song sounds like the promise of immortality. The magic elixir has so many tones. Don't get me wrong. I really want to like these. Because I don't like changing strings. But God, how about the quality control of the clerks? If I have to pay three times the price, is it crazy to expect three times the quality? A little better PS if they see Dario's comments (I like their original music), they will answer a lot of comments and questions. I hope the elixir of immortality will solve my problem here. [editor: now after playing on the guitar for 6 hours, B Xian and D Xian begin to play in the same place. Ask again. The rope is broken three times. What's the use of ""sound is three times"" Xian?] [editor: 10 / 31 / 12. Please! The a line broke after four hours. I only play once or twice a week. Next time I'll joke with the drum list. ""When are you going today?"" He said he was surprised that g was still broadcasting. G was also broadcasting and knew that g was the most nervous. What did you think an hour later? Yes, so four lines were broken in less than 20 hours. Is it true? It's a good price of $9. No, you'll be disappointed for $3. Now the only bonus I can think of is that they hear very well in the program. Although it's new, but damn it, if you don't play completely fluent jazz or similar music, I'll choose skating rink or d'adarios. If I don't have a bad method, this method seems to be three times lower than the normal price. In short, these elixirs have no value of this money at all.

965,"These cables transmit sound very well. Then why only Samsung? Well, these are not the thoughtful instrument cables you can find. These are hard, thick and heavy. Although this is good for most analog cables, these cables are hard and heavy. For example, a portable tuner or a small stamping box may be easy to move, just put one end of the cable in it. Now so many amplifiers have plastic jacks. If these cables can throw the tuner around just by inserting a tuner, what pressure will these cables bring to your amplifier Jack and the output jack installed on pickguard. I mean, let's face it. You never know what will happen at the concert. Sometimes you're playing with a 12 foot cable, and you should have an 18 foot cable. The cable should not be pulled out because of a slight pull, but if it is between the cable falling off and its moving bass head, or you trip over it, you will want the cable to fall off. If all your things are heavy or stick to the ground, it's not a problem, but it's for me. I think when you play with these cables, you worry about stepping on the cable not because you want to pull it out, but because it is really like a tripped wire. Finally, these plugs are huge. If you play strat or tele, it's not a real problem, but what happens when the plug of P-Bass or j-bass is at right angles to the body? It will stand out. Wrap it around your belt. It will be a huge, stiff and bulky ring. I know people often buy 90 degree plugs for these instruments, but most ordinary straight plugs are good. So, yes, if you want to walk around the stage, install more flexible cables. You'll thank me. These cables are just thoughtless. From the pedal to the amplifier (as long as you have a metal jack), they can be used as jumpers, keyboards and drums. Monster has a kind of cable, the price is half that of ordinary cable, but the effect is twice that of ordinary cable in actual instrument use.

You never know what will happen at the concert. Sometimes you play with a 12 foot cable, you should have an 18 foot cable. The cable should not be pulled out due to slight tension, but if the cable falls between the cable and the displacement of the subwoofer, or if you trip on the cable, you will want the cable to fall. If all your things are heavy or stick to the floor, it's not a problem, but it's a problem for me. I think when you play with these cables, you are afraid to step on them, not because you want to disconnect them, but because it is really like a tripped wire. I mean, these traffic jams are huge.

If these cables can throw a tuner by being inserted into just one With many amps that have these cables you may have any type of stress that these cables may place your amp Jack and picguard mount output jacks You must wonder what kind of stress is. Let's face it. You don't know what happens in the gig. Sometimes you're playing with a 12 foot cable when you have to hold a 18 foot cable. Cables should not go out for a gentle pull, but if the cable falls and it is moving the base head, or if you are stumbling on it, you want the cable to fall.

Well, let's face it. You never know what happens at a show. Sometimes you play with a two-meter cable when you need a two-meter cable. A cable shouldn't come out because of a soft pull, but if it falls between the cable and it moves a bass head around or you trip on it, you want the cable to fall. If everything you have is heavy or on the ground, it's not a problem, but it is for me. I get the feeling that when you play with these cables, you're worried about getting on the cable not because you want to pull it out, but because it's serious as a tripwire out there.

I know people often buy 90-degree plugins for those kinds of tools, but most normal straight plugs do fine. So, yes, if you want to move on stage, take more flexible cables. You will thank me. These cables are just ill-conceived. They would work great as patch cords, or keyboards, drum machines, from pedal board to amplifier (as long as you have a metal jack). Monster has a cable that costs half as much but works twice as well for the actual use of instruments, and at that price Pro Co cables are also excellent, and they have brand names, too.",3
970,"These cables work very well when transmitting sound. Why only three stars? Well, these are far from the most sophisticated instrument cables you'll find. They're stiff, fat and heavy. While this is good for most analog cables, these cables are so stiff and heavy that, for example, a portable tuner or a small stompbox can only be moved through one end of this cable. With so many amps that have plastic jackets nowadays, you have to wonder what kind of stress these cables might put your amplifier sockets and pickguard mounted output jackets underneath if these cables can just throw a tuner through a plug into one. I mean, let's be honest. You never know what's gonna happen at a gig. Sometimes you play with a 12-foot cable when you should have an 18-foot cable. A cable shouldn't come out because of a soft pull, but when it falls between the cable and it moves a bass head around or you stumble on it, you want the cable to come out. If everything you have is heavy or Velcro-fastened, it's not a problem, but it's for me. I think when you play with these cables, you're worried about getting into the cable, not because you want to pull it out, but because it's really like a tripwire out there. After all, these plugs are huge. It's not a problem if you're playing the strat or the Tele, but what about a P-Bass or a J-Bass where the connector comes off the body at a right angle? It's gonna sting a lot, and to pull it around your belt, it's gonna be a huge, stiff, heavy-duty loop. I know people often buy 90-degree plugs for these kinds of instruments, but most normal straight plugs just do good. So, yes, if you want to move on stage, get more flexible cables. You'll thank me. These cables are just ill-conceived. You would work well like patch cords, or keyboards, drum machines, from pedal board to amplifier (as long as you have a metal jacket). Monster has a cable that costs half as much, but works twice as well for the actual instrument change, and at this price Pro Co cables are also excellent, and they also have brand plugs.",3
971,"These wires work very well in transmitting sound. Why only three stars? These aren't the best-designed organ cables you'll find. It's rigid, thick and heavy. While this is good for most proportional cables, these cables are so rigid and heavy that, for example, a portable coordinator or a small walking box could easily move around with just one end of that cable there. With so many boosters having plastic valves these days, You have to ask yourself what kind of pressure these wires can be by putting your amplifiers and tailored output caps down if these wires can throw a Coordinator with only one. I mean, let's face it. You never know what's gonna happen at a concert. Sometimes you play with a two-meter cable when you should have an 18-meter cable. A wire shouldn't come out because of a soft pull, but if it's between the wire that falls and that moves a bass head around or if you trip on it, You want the cable to fall out. If all you have is heavy or Velcro'd on the ground, that's not a problem, but it's for me. I feel like when you're playing with these wires, you're worried about whether you're gonna press the wire not because you want to pull it, but because it's really like a wire slide out there. Finally, these bushes are huge. That's not a problem if you play Strat or Tele, but how about a P-Bass or a J-Bass where the plug comes out of the right angle of the body? That's gonna be very distinctive, and to wrap it around your leash, it's gonna be a huge, hard, hard loop. I know people buy supplements for these kinds of instruments a lot, but most normal, straightforward bosses do just fine. So, yeah, if you like to move around the stage, get more flexible wires. You'll thank me. These wires are just poorly designed. They would work perfectly like ribbons, or keyboards, drums, from the pedal to the vineyard (if you have a metal cricket). Monster has a cable that costs half but works twice as well for the actual use of organs, and at this price, Pro Co wires are also excellent, And they've got a business name too.",3
972,"These cables transmit sound very well. Then why only Samsung? Well, these are not the instrument cables you can find. These are hard, thick and heavy things. Most analog cables are good, but they are hard and heavy. For example, a portable scheduler or a small copper cartridge can be easily moved by placing a cable. Now there are so many amplifiers with plastic plugs. If these cables just plug in a governor, you can throw the governor around. What pressure will these cables bring to your amplifier plug and the output plug installed on the pickguard? Let's face it. You never know what will happen at the concert. Sometimes you play with a 12 foot cable, but you have to have an 18 foot cable. The cable shall not be pulled out due to slight tension. However, if the cable falls off or moves the bass head or trips, the cable will fall off. It's not a problem if you weigh everything or stick it to the ground, but it's true for me. I think when you play with these cables, you worry that you step on the cable not because you want to unplug it, but because it is really like a tripped wire. Finally, these plugs are big. If you play straight line or TV, it's not a real problem, but what happens when the plug of P-Bass or j-bass is at right angles to the body? This will stand out. Wrap it around your rope. It will become a huge, stiff and bulky ring. I know people often buy 90 degree plugs for these instruments, but most ordinary plugs are good. So, well, if you want to walk around the stage, install more soft cables. I'll thank you. These cables are just not carefully considered. From the pedal to the amplifier (as long as there is a metal plug), they can be used as jumpers, keyboards and drums. Although the monster has a cable equivalent to half of the general cable, it has twice the effect of the general cable in the use of the actual machine. This price includes not only professional cables, but also brand plugs.",3

Basically, if your amplifier is set to 1970s rock music, you can step on it and get a variegated Crewe, or oz barking in the lunar era.

The circuit design is completely different from the tubular screamer, but it can be used as an alternative (I think if you want the sound of the tubular screamer, the Joyo jf-01 ""vintage overdrive"" pedal will be better, just for simplicity and more like a clone).

My child thinks it looks cool, so he's more likely to stick to it. Even though it has a laminated mechanism, the headstock and unfinished neck are decent wood. These troubles are normal, but there are some sharp endings. I think it's foolish to invest cash to repair them. It is light and easy to operate. The hardware is pretty good. It has a stable bridge (it's best not to put a floating flutter on the bridge), a 5-way blade switch, a solid Jack and belt anchor, and a smooth knob. The pickup is not first-class, but it works well (a decent replacement set will be more expensive than the whole guitar, so I didn't complain). It has a beautiful red paint job.

Hardware does not use a stable bridge (good idea to put floating point, 5 way blade switch, solid Jack and strap anchor, smooth knob). Pick up is not a top notch, but works well (neat replacement sets, I don't complain because the whole guitar costs more). It has good red paint work.

The nut of the string I got is lower in the high pitch than in the low pitch, so the low E county is farther away from the disc than other counties. It has a small pit on its red surface. There are no documents or user instructions. The adjustment period fluctuated slightly. Because the body / neck is bent and too much pressure is applied, everything will go wrong. It is equipped with No. 9 mud board, combined with the scale, relax the strings, easy to press, and is very good for children at the beginning. I like to touch it because it makes a harsh sound. But once he grows up, let's give it up and get a better one.",3

Many UK players simply nail one peg on the wall and then use the loop from the string around the Ke head and tuner.

When I put uke on the hanger, it was hit, so I put the felt pad where uke's body touched the shelf.

For giggling musicians, there is nothing better than these dadario strings. They are light, sound good and cheap. These may require a slight nod on Ernie's string. For more casual musicians, they don't change the strings once a week, which may not be a good choice. Personally, I use the elixir of immortality on my electric guitar, a Les Paul 2008 standard guitar and a Gibson Lucille guitar from 1982.

The coating on the elixir helps keep the corrosion down and easier on my fingers; I like their feeling better than these strings. I played with these strings for about a month. Sadly, these dadario strings can only be played for a week or two. I've tried all kinds of strings, Ernie ball, elixir and dadario. On my guitar and the way I play, the sound and performance of elixir are the best for me. Of course, your mileage may vary. If I really started playing, I might change to a cheaper string. A stupid cosmetic. I hate the packaging of these lines. Dadario has benefited greatly from reduced packaging and environmentally responsible products. These threads are packed in a cardstock box with a plastic package inside. Each size of rope has a ball of different colors at the end to help people calculate the length of the rope. I change the rope myself. I really prefer to wrap the rope in a separate paper letter with the size clearly printed on the package. If you are not familiar with changing strings, or just don't change strings often, this all-in-one package will confuse you. Especially in the beginning, I prefer to use one string at a time. Dadario also made a big deal using the serial number on the package to help combat fake strings. Their website has a place to enter the serial number to verify the authenticity of the stings package. I don't like it. You have to enter an email address to start. They can simply leave a place to enter the serial number without other information. Finally, the stupid colored ball at the end of the string looks silly on my guitar.

The average transmission capacity of the new model is too high and the parts are not easy to change. I thought to replace the old model with a new model, but the new model doesn't deserve a place in my effect chain! Now I can get a small stone, although the pedal seems to be able to change recently.

It is not concentrated enough to be used as strictly as that. My other complaint is the 9 volt slot. Most pedals have a universal design that allows you to use almost any power supply. This pedal is not like this. You are almost downgraded to their own adapter or battery, which is sux IMO, especially because all my pedals run through the adapter chain.

It's not my opinion. It is condensed enough to use it strictly. Another grip I have is a 9 volt slot. Most pedals use universal design to use almost any power supply. This pedal is not. You'll be chased by their own adapters or batteries, which is much more than sux IMO, especially when I run all my pedals from adapter chains.

The bottom line is, I like these, and they'll probably last me almost forever, but I don't see them making my choices. I like the thickness and feel (you won't slip out of your hand while playing) but the great loss is just enough that I don't think I want to limit myself that way, except in certain cases. I tend to switch back and forth between a ladder and fingers anyway, so I already have a sound similar to that using my fingers. It's worth a try, though, and you can find a guard if you need to tame an amp or a guitar that's a little lighter. You know, in higher volumes, it's easy for high frequencies to be accentuated, And these could work better in a living environment where you have your amplifier up.",3
1880,"I have tried these three types. They are not different from advertising. I really don't find that the relative hardness of rubber has a great difference in tone, but it exists to a certain extent. These sounds are too dull for me to hear. Well, they sound good, but if you continue to switch to normal coin picking, you will find that high and medium high frequencies, which will be weakened by softer attacks. This sounds good, but it's good in any application. But I don't want to turn it into a daily complaint. The electric guitar performs better. The difference in aggressiveness may not be obvious, but you will still find some flashes disappear. But in most cases, I think this sound is very appropriate and useful. Pickaxes tend to catch ropes. Of course, there is more friction, but it just needs to be used to it. In a word: I like these. They can last almost forever, but I really don't think they are my first choice. I like its thickness and touch. They don't slip out of your hands when they play But advanced losses are enough. I don't want to limit myself in this way. Except in some cases. Anyway, I tend to walk back and forth between the pickaxe and my fingers, and I have heard similar sounds with my fingers. But if you want to tame an overly bright amplifier or guitar, you can find a goalkeeper. You know it's easy to emphasize high frequency at higher volume. In the field environment, if you have started the amplifier, you will do better.",3
1881,"I like the medium version of these pickaxes very much. I just ordered some 3.1mm thick hard pickaxes. By the way, it's quite thick. Therefore, unless your electronic organ has a wide neck and heavy strings, it can only be used on bass and acoustic guitar.

My conclusion is: choose medium or hard version.",3

And it makes it more difficult to handle them -- it's great for them to remove choice noise, but these softer wants to cling to strings and require players to make too many adjustments. My verdict: move in medium or hard version.",3

Therefore, unless your violin is wide and heavy, it can only be used on bass and original guitar.

My conclusion is: choose the medium and hard version.",3

At 2020 is the first sound track on the top of each other is a pretty bright microphone that sounds good at first but it can produce very harsh sound. Second, it is not a real large diaphragm condenser. It starts with a very good microphone music for people or just uses it for podcasts but there are a bunch of good microphones near this price. Two of the minds are the price of the special microphone for both MXL v67g and studio project B1 (away from studio project C1). Although there is one microphone, it is a little expensive, but absolutely amazing, mxl2003a. Many people claim that the studio project's C1 sound not nominated as U87, but it does not, mxl2003a is very similar, and is easily the best LDC microphone below $500. That means that at 2020 is not a bad microphone, it's not great, just to people who are using it built into the computer or camera mic, this will blow them away, but as time goes by, they will learn the limitations of this microphone. Although it is fair, I have a lot of experience in professional audio and production, but I may be slightly overly important.

Two that come to mind are the MXL V67g and Studio projects B1 (stay away from studio projects C1) both exceptional microphones for the price. Although there is a microphone you that is a bit more expensive, but is absolutely amazing, the MXL 2003a. Many people have claimed that the studio projects C1 sound when the Neumann-u87 does not work, but the MXL 2003a sounds very similar and is easily the best LDC mic under $500.

My hand is very small and I have an old injury to my wrist, so I prefer to place capo with as few strains as possible. In this regard, this one is better than any buckle (key chain, etc.).

On the bright side, this unit seems to be doing well, so it should last a long time. I think it meets all the criteria, except that it must be tightened periodically. I have tried many capos. The only thing I like is the planet waves spiral gyroscope. They are easy to use and easy to change from one worry to another. Their hands are light, consistent and unimpeded, but they will break in the humid weather in California (in a few months, I have four broken on me. They will break and fly into the air, which is very dangerous). Next, I will try Dunlop Victor capos, which are spiral tops similar to the style of Planet Waves (Dunlop also produces Planet Waves capos) But they are made of more durable bronze, so they should last longer.

I especially don't think the horizontal axis point is good. I mean, you adjust the angle of the boom. This is a cheap version of a simple design. I doubt you will find a way to prevent it from sagging one day. The problem is that its surface area is much smaller, the friction is much smaller, and it will be tighter before something comes out. The fastening screw for sliding it also looks bad. I predict that one day you will replace it from the pipe tape. I am more based on my experience in sound reinforcement, which is more difficult on equipment than recording, because I have these two types of business.

2087,"It's fine for standard, rather stationary use. We use these in my church, and they get moved a little, but not much. For the price, they're surprisingly sturdy, and they work fine. From stands in this price class, this is the top of what I've been through. It is easily adjustable, the screws remain tight as soon as the adjustments are made, it is light but not so light that it rolls or blows over, the feet keep it stable on the floor and of swings. Seriously, for those of you who don't need a booth who can handle tours or a lot of crap, this is the one you should go with. If you need a booth to perform live performances and/or go on tour, sail around in planes or buses, etc., you need an upgrade or two in quality (and, unfortunately, price).",3
2088,"It's perfect for standard use, quite stationary. We use these in my church, and they are moved a little, but not much. For the price they are surprisingly solid and work perfectly. Of the stands in this price range, this is at the top of what I've experienced. It is easily adjustable, the screws remain fixed as soon as the settings are made, it is easy, but not so easy that it tilts or blows over, the feet keep it stable on the floor and from shaking. Seriously, for those who don't need a stand that can handle tours or play a lot, it's the right one. If you need a booth to do live gigs and/or go on tour, sailing in planes or vans, etc., you need to increase one or two degrees of quality (and, unfortunately, price).",3
2089,"It's fine for normal, fairly stable use. We use these in my church, and they move a little, but not a lot. For the price, they're amazingly solid, and they work perfectly. From the positions on this range, this is at the top of what I've experienced. It's easy to adjust, the screws stay tight once the settings are made, it's light but not enough to land or blow, Feet to keep it steady on the floor and from swinging. Seriously, for those of you who don't need a place that can handle tours or lots of games around, this is the one to go with. If you need a booth to handle live concerts and/or sightseeing, transport to planes or trucks, etc. etc., you should upgrade the quality (and, unfortunately, the price).",3
2090,"It is very suitable for standard and fixed use. We used these in my church. They moved a little, but not much. In terms of price, they are surprisingly strong and work well. In this price range, this is the highest point I have experienced. It is easy to adjust. Once the adjustment is completed, the screw will not loosen. Although the screw is very light, it is not light enough to overturn or fall, and the foot can be stable on the floor. To be honest, this is an appropriate choice for people who don't need a tour or a large number of display cabinets. If you need to deal with booths for live performances and / or tours, planes or vans, improve the quality by one or two grades (unfortunately, the price will also rise).",3

For me, as far as I know, this has not increased for those who use a lot of distortion in music. This will never increase any obesity. Therefore, my overall impression is that this box provides the same thing that some people swear they feel better because of arthritis or vitamin E therapy instead of copper bracelets.

From what I've heard, it's nothing to me for those who use a significant distortion in their music. It definitely doesn't add any more grease. My overall impression is that this box is exactly what some people swear to get copper bracelets for their arthritis or feel better with increased vitamin E therapy. In other words, it's about what's in your head and how suggestive you are. Most musicians already use EQ and Reverb and by carefully ticking these two things you can get what you think you can get out of this pedal, I think.",3
2281,"For those of you doing things jangly pop or real boring, bitey blues material (think Albert Collins), this will add a little, and I mean a little, extra intense to your sound. Sounds like he's using a touch of turnip and a pinch of the upper extremity of the muscles to make the cleaning sound brighter. But you should also be able to get the same sounds from a Hughes and Kettner Statesman 40 or 60 watt amp, too, just run it straight. In my opinion, from what I have heard, it adds nothing to those who use a fair amount of distortion in their music. It certainly doesn't add any more fat. So, My general impression is that what this box provides is the same thing that some people swear they get from the brass bracelets for their arthritis or feel better with an increased vitamin E treatment. In other words, the point is what's in your head and how excited you are. Most musicians already use EQ and reverb and with careful adaptation of these two things you can get what you think you're getting from this pedal, I think.",3

It seems to use some mixes and more advanced mids to make the clean sound brighter. But the politicians of Hughes and ketner should hear the same voice. A 40 Watt or 60 Watt Amplifier just runs it directly. For me, as far as I know, this has not increased for people who often use reality in music. This will never increase any obesity. So my overall impression is that this box provides arthritis or vitamin E therapy, vowing not to use copper bracelets. In other words, it's about what's in your mind and how easily you're implied. Most musicians have used EQ and mix. I think you can get some ideas from this pedal by carefully adjusting these two situations.",3

It's a strange box sent back, Mail that may exceed $8. But in the end I understood. I am a 5-foot-10-inch tall man. This shelf is high enough because I open it on the road. If I want to lift it to the maximum, it is to add another inch of space. It seems that those who complain about height don't realize that all three segments can be extended to show the full height (they may only be raised by 2 / 3). So, in terms of price, I think you pay because I just want to have a booth in my bedroom. I think that's enough, but if you're going to travel with him, Or, if you buy it for children under the age of 18, I suggest you buy a stronger unit than this, because they can break it in a short time. Then you pay $15 for a new one. In fact, this is a fragile piece of garbage, which may be useful to a responsible adult. He will treat him very carefully (such as me), But not for children or drunkards, he is fragile and easy to break. I accepted this suggestion. I only need to tighten the handle of the height regulator with the handle, so I don't need to press it hard, because the previous commentators have proved that if it is too tight, Then it's easy to pull out the bolt, so be very careful. I will keep mine, but if I have to buy a second suit, I won't buy it, because I don't like fragile garbage. I think even my big dog can break it.",3
2383,"Some complaints are right about this cheap unit. First of all, I had to mess with it for almost fifteen minutes to get the right because it looks like I have a previously returned unit that another customer must have bent the arms the wrong way along the joints and I was careful not to wring it because I could see it would break if it bent the wrong way with Lots of power. I was about to give up but I felt bad about doing the return because I didn't want Amazon to lose money and this is a strange form of box and probably cost over $8 in the mail to send back to them. But eventually I found out. I'm a five or ten centimeter tall man and this booth is big enough because I totally opened it and there was still an inch or two missing if I wanted to raise it to the maximum. It seems that those complaining about the height did not realize that all three segments can be extended to reveal the full height (She probably only raised 2 from the three segments). So for the price I think you get what you pay and since I just want a booth that stays in my bedroom I think this unit will suffice but if you plan to travel around with it or if you get it for a child under eighteen years old I recommend you buy a stronger unit than this because they Probably break in short order. And then you lose the fifteen dollars and you have to buy a new one. The truth is that it is a thin piece of waste, okay for a responsible adult who treats it with great care (like me) but not for children or drunks, it is very vulnerable and easy to break. I took the advice and pulled the control buttons for height only finger tight without great force, as previous evaluators confirm that it is easy to pull the bolt out if you are too tight so be very, very careful. I'll keep mine, but if I had to buy a second unit, I wouldn't buy this because I don't like loose junk and I feel like even my big dog can take this down and break the damn thing.",3
2384,"Some of the complaints about this cheap unit are well-founded.

I was about to give up, but I felt bad about making the comeback because I didn't want Amazon to lose money, and this is a weirdly shaped box and probably costs over $8 in Porto to send it back. But eventually I found out. I'm a 5-ft 10-inch tall, and this booth is big enough because I've opened it all the way and I've got one or two inches to spare if I want to keep it up to the maximum. It looks as if those who complain about the height did not know that all three segments can be stretched to see the full height (they probably only raised two from the three segments). So for the price, I think you'll get what you're paying for, and since I only have a booth that will stay in my bedroom, I think this unit will do, but if you're planning to travel with her or if you're getting it for a child under 18-year-olds, I recommend you buy a more robust unit than this one, because they probably break in a short order. And then you'll have to buy the fifteen dollars plus a new one. The truth is that it is a weak piece of trash, okay for a responsible adult who will treat it with great care (like me) but not for children or drunks, it is very fragile and easy to break.

2385,"Some of the complaints are justified in relation to this cheap unit. First of all, I had to carry it for almost fifteen minutes to open it properly, Because it looks like I have an old returning unit that another client must have bent his hands the wrong way along the joints and I was careful not to touch it. Because I could tell it would break if he bent it too hard. I was about to give up, But I felt bad about coming back because I didn't want to make the Amazon lose money and this is a weird box shape and it probably costs more than $8 in mail place to send it back to them. But I finally figured it out. I'm very tall and this position is high enough because I opened it up to the end and there was still an inch or two to spare if I wanted to put it up to the maximum. It seems that those who complained about the height did not realize that all three sections could stretch to reveal the full height (probably only two of the three sections rise) So, for the price I think you're getting, and since I just want a booth that stays in my room at home, I think this unit will be enough, but... If you plan to travel around with it or if you take it for a child under 18-year-old I suggest you buy a more stable unit than that because you'll probably break it in a small h And then you'll lose fifteen dollars plus you'll have to buy a new one, the truth is it's a weak piece of trash, okay for a responsible adult deals with great care (like me) But not for children or drunks, it's very fragile and easy to break.

2386,"There are good reasons for the partial prosecution of the cheap League member. First, I groped for nearly 15 minutes to open it. Because I seem to have got my former League member. Other customers must bend their arms in the wrong direction along the joint. I didn't handle it carefully. Because I can judge that if I bend too much in the wrong direction, my arm will break. I wanted to give up, but I'm sorry to return it. Because I don't want Amazon to suffer. Because this is a box with strange shape, it may cost more than $8 for postage after sending it. I finally know. I am a man 5 feet 10 inches tall. This lathe is tall enough. Because I want to open it. If I want to maximize it, there is still one or two inches of space. People who complain about height don't seem to realize that every three paragraphs may increase to represent the overall height. (they may have improved only two of the three paragraphs.) Therefore, in terms of price, I think what you get is what you pay. Because I think a booth in my bedroom is enough. But if you travel around with it, or you buy it for children under the age of 18, I suggest you buy a stronger member than this. Because they can break it in a short time. Besides, you have to spend that 15 yuan to buy a new one. In fact, it is a kind of fragile garbage, which is possible for responsible adults. He will treat it very carefully. But not for children and drunk people. It's fragile and easy to break. I accept the suggestion that as long as I tighten the height adjustment switch by hand, I don't have to use too much force. Because previous critics have proved that if you are too nervous, it is easy to pull out the bolt, so you should be very careful. I will keep me.

Well, that's t for flying accidents, but don't even get close to abusing your instrument while it's housed in t h is case, because you may be disappointed to buy new parts if the ""Guardian"" isn't careful about crushing your hardware. This point isn't one of the better cases out there, but it's enough, and it looks good. The first day I got it, someone said, ""Nice case, he looks great!""

This is to handle flight cases, but don't you dare abuse your instrument while it's in the case, Because you might be disappointed that you have to buy new parts when the warden can't protect you from crushing your material. This point isn't one of the best cases out there, but it's enough and it looks good. The first day I got it, someone said, ""Good case, looks great!""

Because it's a guitar box. However, in order to protect the musical instruments of the aircraft, there can not be sufficient safety. Now it's a problem to deal with in the trunk of the aircraft, but when putting the machine into this box, don't even approach the abuse of the machine. Because once the guardian can't prevent damage to your hardware, you may be disappointed to buy new parts. This project is not in a better situation, but it is indeed enough. It seems all right. The first day I received it, someone said. ""The box is good. It looks good!"" But let's say that now. If you use it four times outside your home, you'll become a liar",3

Now, I am definitely not the kind of person who automatically denies the quality of products made in China. In fact, I made many music works of surprisingly good quality there. However, this commodity has some advantages, and there are also some stereotypes of Chinese commodities. Advantages: cheap. Strong, unlike some critics, I like higher height. From an ergonomic point of view, it's much better for you not to bend down and twist your neck and trachea. I also like tighter springs, although it takes a little time to adapt. But the security of your harp is worth your extra effort. Now, the disadvantage is: what others say is true: the plastic neck tube smells. It's not as bad as some people say, but a nasty chemical smell must be obvious. I cut it off and bought a large and wide replacement tube at tap plastics for a dollar (make sure the tube you bought is wide enough to slide at the bend of the neck ring rod - I got a 1 / 2 inch diameter) Second, perhaps the bigger problem is the uneven bending of metal. My metal side is obviously higher than the other side, and the ring of my neck is far away. I tried my best to bend all the parts evenly, but the flat metal parts are difficult to form. The reason I didn't return was that I thought most of them were equally uneven: I just imagined a bunch of PO or souls who desperately bent these suction cups with their hands, with little or no machine help to ensure consistency.

Some of the most basic expectations are not met, which is annoying (like keeping the height of both sides of the harmonica in an equal position).

However, the product has certain advantages, and there are also some problems related to Chinese product stereotypes. Advantages: cheap. Strong. Unlike some critics, I prefer taller. From an ergonomic point of view, you'd better not bend down and twist your neck and trachea. I also like the spring to be tighter, although it takes a little time to adapt.

I cut it off and bought a large, large-area TAPP plastic pipe for a dollar (make sure the tube you buy is wide enough to slide on the neck curve with the ring - I got a 1 / 2 inch diameter) Second, perhaps the more serious problem is the non-uniformity of metal bending.

I cut this off and got a big, wide replacement tube for a dollar at TAP Plastics (make sure that what you get is far enough to slide over the bends in the neck loop bar --I have the 1/2 diameter) The second and perhaps bigger problem is that the metal is NOT evenly bent. Mine was significantly bigger on one side than the other, and the neck loop was off. I did my best to match all parts, but the flat metal part is hard to form.

2778,"This device works. That's what it does. Plug the electronic bass into the instrument input of the pedal, then plug the second standard instrument cable into the high impedance output jack of the pedal, and then plug the cable into the bass amplifier. You can also connect it to a low impedance microphone preamplifier through a 200 ohm low impedance XLR Jack. You can use only high impedance output or XLR output, or both. When the ""foot switch"" is turned off, its function is transparent without any tone change, just like a direct box. When the ""foot switch"" is turned on, the LED light is activated and the tone enhancement and tube simulation functions are turned on. I put the ""foot switch"" in quotation marks because I pushed it with my fingers, but kept it open for my personal purposes. When you plug the plug into the instrument input jack, the device will be powered on, so if you run on a battery, make sure to unplug the input when it is not actually used. Some other functional comments about it. It operates on a 9 volt battery or a 9 volt power supply. I used the battery for a while, but replaced it with an AC adapter. The battery life is not very long, but satisfactory. But if you use it often, I recommend using an AC adapter. When the battery starts working, it sounds bad, but you can put it in bypass mode to complete the setting. In addition, when the ""foot switch"" is off and the LED is not lit, this device can be used as a direct XLR output box for anything you insert. You can connect the output of the acoustic electric guitar or the output of the electric guitar pedal to it and use it to record directly for the mixer, which is a very convenient function for home recording lovers! Amplifier Analog and tone control are wrong for anything except electric bass, so just use it as a direct speaker for anything except bass and turn off the tone / analog circuit. Except for the ground lifting switch as a sliding switch, the control device is a rotary knob. From left to right, from the first row to the second row, the controls are: drive, treble, bass, volume, status, ground lift, sliding switch and mixing. It is important to control one control at a time to understand their function, because they are not all in a logical position. The drive knob adjusts the gain, similar to the input stage control of the start-up tube preamplifier, where you can obtain a tone thickness (or edge) similar to the overdrive tube tone. Basically, this part of the circuit is injected with variable harmonics and some more pleasant distortions. There is no active / passive pad switch or additional active input jack on this pedal, so if you have active bass, you don't have to turn the drive knob up too much to get the required tone. The treble knob is a + or - 12dB boost and a high-frequency tone cut. The bass knob is a + or - 12 dB boost and lower frequency. On the treble and bass knobs, 12 o'clock is flat (or zero DB up or down). The volume knob is the main volume control. All it does is control the output volume without tone coloring. The status knob can increase the content of high-frequency harmonics and make your tone more aggressive. The status knob is not a mid-range control, but it can be raised to the mid-range. The ground lift switch only affects the XLR output jack and should be kept ""off"" unless you connect it and make a buzzing sound. You can then ""turn on"" the ground lift, which may help eliminate the buzzing problem. However, from a safety point of view, it is best to solve this problem by eliminating the electrical grounding loop conflict that causes buzzing. The mixing knob controls the tube analog output of the injection pedal. The tube analog on the left is none, the tube analog at 12 o'clock is 50%, and the tube analog clockwise is 100%. Disadvantages: few bass devices or other things are ""perfect"" now. BEHRINGER gear generally has more manufacturing problems in most of its product lines, because using Chinese parts and labor is their way to reduce costs. Designed in Germany, but made in China means you can get Chinese components and Chinese construction quality, and the specifications look quite attractive. For example, when replacing the battery for the first time, the battery clip destroys itself because part of the terminals of the battery clip are stuck on the battery and completely pull out the battery clip. This is the standard configuration of Duracell battery and pedal battery. Went to the radio shed, changed a battery clip, fixed it with a new clip, welded the welding wire on the new clip to the peeling wire cut from the old clip, and then wrapped the welding point with tape. I've never used it as a foot pedal, because if you step on it hard, the switch looks broken. Buildings are all plastic. The housing is very durable, but based on my previous experience using plastic switches on the stamping box, I know not to use my 13-D size feet on it. My tweeter and status knob will produce hiss and noise when set very high, which may not be obvious on old bass amplifiers without tweeters, but it will become dazzling when using full-range amplifiers and speakers, or when using XLR output for recording or PA feeding. Basically, I set the treble and status to the point where I hear the hiss, and then go back until it completely disappears, because this is a functional limitation. Since the preamplifier is off, hiss has no problem in bypass mode. Jacks other than XLR are plastic box jacks directly welded to the pedal circuit board. These types of jacks will cause problems, especially after rough use, so be careful when using them, and they should be able to be used for a long time. This phone doesn't have any special midrange knob, but the status knob seems to increase the upper midrange and treble at the same time. Some people use this pedal as a stage tool and as a solo or ""exclusive"" switch for clapping and percussion solos. Therefore, in any case, the solo switch basically only needs to be present, bass and treble enhancement. Advantages: first of all, when you consider any price with similar characteristics, the price is almost too good, but remember, it has a durability problem, so keep it gentle and it will last indefinitely. This is not a New York State tech 21 bass driver, but it works similar to one. I have a tech 21 bass drive luxury that I use at concerts. Tech 21 sounds better, but the price is about eight times that of BEHRINGER. I use Bellinger at home and keep it on the pedal at home. If I don't have a tech 21 device, I may take it to the show, but it may last longer, just as I keep it at home. I especially like this unit when used in combination with small rehearsals / exercises. Many of these small combinations have passive tone circuits. When the tone is fully turned on, these circuits are basically flat, and this device does make the sound of these small amplifiers more serious. Part of the beauty of active bass is that there is no tone enhancement in passive bass. If you have passive bass, it can make it sound more like active bass. Treble and bass enhancement are in front of the amplifier. It also helps to enhance the signal in front of longer cables to the back end, such as any cable over 18 feet. Recording XLR direct output is very useful. If your amplifier does not have XLR direct output, XLR direct output can also be used to power PA on gig. How to use this device: I plug the bass guitar into the input and use the XLR output to connect it to the microphone mixer. The output of the microphone mixer is spliced into the Turtle Beach Santa Cruz sound card in the XP computer. Then I can use the computer recording software to record, practice solo, or play the recorded music with headphones. With headphones, I can play the sound I want at any time without disturbing anyone. Most computer speakers are not suitable for bass, so I recommend using headphones instead of typical desktop speakers. You can buy better computer speakers, but their price is about the same as or even higher than a good bass guitar practice combination amplifier. The price of high-quality headphones is much lower than that of high-quality computer speakers supporting bass guitar. I have owned this pedal for about 4 years, and know what I know about it, I will buy it again. I strongly recommend it as a home recording / practice tool, but as a stage tool, my suggestion is not so strong. Just use it at home. You can use it at concerts, but I'll save ""gig bones"" and buy something more durable and better.",3
2779,"This device is running. This is the feeling. Plug the electronic bass into the pedal instrument input, then plug the second standard instrument cable into the pedal high impedance output socket, and then plug the cable into the bass amplifier. You can also connect it to a low impedance microphone preamplifier through a 200 ohm low impedance XLR Jack. You can only use high impedance or XLR output, or both. When the pedal switch is off, it works in a transparent way without any tone change, just like a direct box. When the foot switch is on, the LED lights up and the tone enhancement and tube simulation functions are activated. I put the switch in quotation marks because I pushed it away with my finger, but I kept turning it on for my own benefit. When you plug the plug into the input socket of the instrument, the device will be powered on, so if you use a battery, make sure to disconnect the input when you are not actually using it. Some other notes on this function. It uses a 9 volt battery or a 9 volt power supply. I used the battery for some time, but changed an AC adapter. The battery life is not very long, but it is satisfactory. However, if you use it often, I recommend using an AC adapter. When the battery starts working, it sounds bad, but you can set it to bypass mode to complete the setting. In addition, when the foot switch is off and the LED is not on, the device can be used as a direct XLR output box for anything inserted. You can connect the acoustic electric guitar output or electric guitar pedal output to it and use it to record directly for the mixer, which is a very convenient function for home recording lovers! Except for the electric bass, the analog and tone control of the amplifier are incorrect, so just turn off the tone / analog circuit and use the amplifier as a direct speaker for everything except bass. The control device is a rotary button, but the ground lifting switch is a sliding switch. From left to right, the controls from the first row to the second row are: drive, treble, bass, volume, status, ground lifting sliding switch and mixing. Controlling one control at a time is important to understand its function, because not all controls are in a logical position. The way the drive button adjusts the gain is similar to the input level control of the starter tube preamplifier. In this case, you can obtain a pitch (or edge) thickness similar to the tone of the booster tube. In essence, this part of the circuit injects variable harmonics and some more pleasant distortions. There is no active / passive pad switch or additional active input socket on this pedal, so if you have an active bass, you don't have to turn the drive knob too high to get the required tone. The tweeter button increases by + or - 12dB, and the high-frequency tone decreases. The low frequency button increases by + 12 dB or - 12 dB, and the frequency decreases. On the treble and bass buttons, 12 hours is flat (or zero DB up or down). The volume knob is the main volume control. It only controls the output volume without tone. The status button increases the content of high-frequency harmonics and makes your tone more aggressive. The status button is not a mid-range control, but it does raise the mid-range. The ground lift switch only affects the XLR output socket and must remain ""off"" unless you connect and hum. Then you can ""turn on"" the ground elevator, which helps eliminate the hum. However, from a safety point of view, it is best to solve this problem by eliminating the grounding circuit conflict causing buzzing. The mixing button controls the amount of analog pipe at the outlet of the injection pedal. The analog quantity of left tube is zero, the analog quantity of 12 hour tube is 50%, and the analog quantity of clockwise needle tube is 100%. Disadvantages: few bass devices or other things are ""perfect"" now. BEHRINGER gear has more manufacturing problems in most of its product lines because using Chinese parts and labor is their way to reduce costs. Designed in Germany, but made in China means you can get Chinese parts and Chinese construction quality, The specifications look attractive. For example, when replacing the battery for the first time, the battery clamp will damage itself because some terminals of the battery clamp are clamped on the battery and the battery clamp has been completely removed. This is the standard configuration of Duracell battery and pedal. I went to the radio shed, changed a battery clip, fixed it with a new clip, welded the welding wire on the new clip to the peeling wire on the old clip, and wrapped the welding joint with adhesive tape. I've never used it as a pedal, because if you push it hard, the switch seems to be off. The building is made of plastic. The housing is very durable, but based on my previous experience using plastic switches on the buffer box, I know I don't want to use my 13-D size feet on it. My tweeter and status button will hiss and make noise when set very high, which may not be obvious on the old bass amplifier without tweeter, but it will become dazzling when using full range amplifier and speaker, Or when using XLR output for recording or PA power supply. Basically, I set the treble and status to the point where the whistle starts, and then move back until it disappears completely, because this is a functional limitation. Since the preamplifier is off, hiss has no problem in bypass mode. Non XLR sockets are plastic shell sockets directly welded to the pedal circuit board. These types of sockets may cause problems, especially after rough use, so they must be used with care and for a long time. The phone doesn't have a dedicated midrange button, but the status button seems to increase both midrange and treble. Some people use this pedal as a stage tool and use it as a solo or ""exclusive"" switch to tap and tap solo. Therefore, in any case, the solo switch basically only needs the presence of high voice, low voice and enhancement. Advantages: first of all, when you consider the price of other similar functions, the price is almost too high, but remember that it has durability problems, so keep it gentle, and it will last indefinitely. This is not a 21 bass pilot from New York State, but it works the same way. I have a 21 bass driver luxury technology that I use in concerts. Tech21 looks better, but its price is about eight times that of BEHRINGER. I used the Bellinger map at home and put it on the pedal at home. If I don't have tech 21 equipment, I may take it to the show, but it may last longer, just as I leave it at home. I especially like this unit when it is used in conjunction with small repetitions / exercises. Many of these small combinations have passive tone circuits. When the tone is fully turned on, these circuits are basically flat. This device makes these small amplifiers more noisy. Part of the beauty of active bass is that it enhances the tones that are not available in passive bass. If you have a passive bass, you can make it more active and enhance the treble and bass in front of the amplifier. It also helps to enhance forward signals, such as any cable longer than 18 feet. Recording XLR direct output is very useful. If your amplifier does not have XLR direct output, you can also use XLR direct output to power the PA on the gig. How to use this device: I plug the bass guitar into the input and use the XLR output to connect it to the microphone mixer. The output of the microphone mixer is connected to the Turtle Beach Santa Cruz sound card on the XP computer. Then, I can use the computer recording software to record, practice solo, or play the recorded music with headphones. With headphones, I can play the sound I want at any time without disturbing anyone. Most computer speakers are not suitable for bass, so I recommend using headphones instead of typical desktop speakers. You can buy better computer speakers, but they cost about the same or more as a good combination d-drive amplifier",3

2782,"This device works. This is what it does. You put an electric bass in the pedal instrument... and then you can plug a second standard instrumental cable into the high impedant output jack of the pedal... And then you plug it into a base amplifier. You can also connect it with a low impedance microphone preamp via the 200 Ohm low impedance XLR jacket. You can only use the high-impedance output or only the XLR output or you can use both at the same time. When the footswitch is switched off, it functions transparently with no tonal modification at all, just like a direct field. When the ""footswitch"" is activated on a LED light and the tonal boost and tube emulation functions are on. I put ""footswitch"" in quotes because I use fingers to push it, but always leave it on for my personal purpose. When you plug a plug in the instrument input jack the unit power on, so if turning on the battery is sure to turn off the input when it does not actually use it. A few other functional remarks. It runs on 9-volt batteries or a 9-volt power supply. I used batteries for a while, but I switched to an adapter. Battery life is not super but satisfying. But if you use it often, I suggest you use a change adapter. When the battery goes, it sounds terrible, but you can put it in bypass mode to finish the set. Even if the ""footswitch"" is off and the joint is not lit, this thing functions as a straight XLR unbuttoned direct box for everything you put in it. You can use the output of an acoustic electric guitar or the output of an electric guitar pedal board a and use it to run a mixer for recording straight away, which is a very convenient feature for the home recording hobbyist! The amp emulation and tone controls are wrong for anything other than electric bass, so use it as a direct box with the tone/emulation circuit off for everything except bass. The controls are all rotary buttons, except the ground lift switch, which is a sliding switch. The controls left to right, top row to second row are: DRIVE, TREBLE, BASS, LEVEAU, PRESENCE, GROND LIFT SLIDE SWINTCH and BLEND. Taking each control one by one to understand what they are doing is important because they are not all placed logically. The DRIVE button controls the amount of profit that is similar to turning the inlet rule of the tube preemp and here is where you can get something like the tonal thickness (or edge) of excessive tube tone. In principle, this part of the circuit injects variable harmonics and part of the more pleasant distortion there for this purpose. There is no ACTIVE/PASSIVE path switch or extra active input jack on this pedal, so if you have an active base then you do not have to turn the drive button up to get the desired to on. The TREBLE button is a + or --12db boost and cut of the upper frequencies. The BASS button is a + or --12db boost and cut of the lower frequencies. 12 o'hour is flat (or zero db boost or cut) on both the treble and bass buttons. The LEVEL button is the main volume control and all it does is check the output volume without tonal colouring. The PRESENCE button strengthens the harmonic content of the upper frequency... for more attacks on your tone. The button of the Presence is not mediocre, but strengthens the upper middle ring. The GROND LIFT switch only affects the XLR output jack and it should be ""disabled"" unless you hook it up and there is a buzzer. Then you can turn the Ground Lift ""On"" and it can help eliminate the hum problem. From a safety point of view, however, it is better to remedy this by removing the electrical connection conflict that causes noise. The BLEND button controls the amount of tube emulation injected into the output of the pedal with all the way to the left is none, 12-hour is 50% and all the way towards the clock is 100%. Very little basic equipment, or anything else, is ""perfect"" these days. Controller acceleration has more construction problems generally in most of their product line because the use of Chinese parts and labor is how they keep costs low. Designed in Germany but built in China means that your Chinese components and Chinese build quality while the specs look pretty tempting. For example, during the first battery change, the battery clip self-destructed as part of the terminal of the clip remained attached to the battery that has been completely removed from the clip. This was a Duracell battery, the standard for pedal batteries. Went to Radio Shack and got replacement battery clips and fixed it with a new clip by soldering wires from the new clip to the striped wires cut from the old clip and sticking the soldering bolt. I've never used this as a punching box because the switch seems to break when you lean hard on it. The building is plastic. The housing is very durable, but based on previous experience with plastic switches on punching boxes I don't know how to use my size 13-D foot on it. The Treble and Presence buttons on mine will hiss and sound when set very high which are not noticeable at all on a vintage type bass amplifier without tweeter, but is dazzling when using a full range of amps and cabinets or when using the XLR output for recording or a PA feed. In principle, I put the Treble and the Presence at the point where I hear hisses begin, and then back until it goes completely away because that is the functional limit. Hiss is not a problem in bypass mode because the preamp is off. The crutches, with the exception of the XLR, are the plastic boxes that are soldered directly on the pedal's circuit board, This type of crutches are noticed for causing problems, especially after rough use, so take it easy with them and they must last a very long time. This unit does not have a specific MIDRANGE button, but the Presence button seems to stimulate and displace the upper midline at the same time. Some people who use this pedal as a stage tool use it as a solo or ""scoop"" switch for hitting ^tapsolo s, so the presence, bass and treble boost are actually all you need for a solo switch anyway. PROS: First of all, the price is almost too good to be true when you get the price for something else with similar functions, but keep in mind that the sustainability problems are therefore careful with it and it will take forever. This is not a Tech 21 NYC Bass Driver, but works in a similar way. I have a Tech 21 Bass Driver Deluxe that I use on gigs. The Tech 21 sounds better, but it costs about eight times what the Controller costs. I'll use the Behringer at home and keep that wear and tear at home on my pedal board. If I didn't have the Tech 21 unit, I'd take this unit to gigs, but it'll probably take longer, like I always keep it at home. I especially like this unit when used with small repetition/practice type combo s. Many of these smaller combos have passive type tone circuits that are basically flat when the tone is connected wide op en and this device really makes these small amplifiers sound more serious. Part of the beauty of an active base is the tone boost capacity that you do not get in a passive base and if you have a passive base this can make the lake sound like an active base with the treble and bass boost for the amplifier. It is also useful for increasing a signal for a longer cable track to the backline, say something about eighteen meters. For recording the XLR directly from is very useful and the XLR directly off can also be used to power the PA to an action if your amplifier does not output XLR directly. How to use this device: I have connected my bass guitar to the input and use the XLR output to connect it to a microphone mixer. The output of the microphone mixer is connected to a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz sound card in an XP computer. I can then record using the recording software of the computer, practice solo or I can play with recorded music using headphones. With a headphone, I can play as hard as I want, whenever I want, without disturbing anyone. Most computer loudspeakers are very inadequate for electrical bass, so I order headphones instead of your typical desktop computer loudspeakers. You can buy better computer loudspeakers that are capable, but they will cost about the same or actually more than a decent guitar combo amplifier. Quality headphones cost far less than quality-driven computer loudspeakers capable of bass. If I've owned this pedal for four years and I know what I know about it, I'd buy it again. I would strongly recommend it as a home recording/practice tool, but my recommendation as a performance tool is not so strong. It's fine for home. You can use it on gigs, but I'm saving joints to buy something more sustainable with better performance.",3
2783,"The device works. That's how it works. You insert an electric bass into the pedal's instrument input and then you can insert a second standard instrument into the pedal high impedance output and then insert it into a bass amplifier. With the 200 Ohm Low Impedance XLR connection you can also connect it with a low Impedance Microphone Preamplifier. You can only use the high impedance output or only the XLR output or both at the same time. When the ""foot switch"" is switched off, it functions transparently without any sound modification like a direct box. When the ""foot switch"" is switched on, an LED light is activated and the pitch and tube emulation functions are switched on. I put ""foot switches"" in quotes because I press them with my fingers, but I always put them on for my personal purpose. If you insert a plug into the instrument input, the device will switch on. So if you're running on the battery, you need to be sure to deactivate the entrance if you're not actually using it. Some other functional comments on this. It runs on 9-volt batteries or a 9-volt power supply. I used batteries for a while, but I switched to an AC adapter. The battery life is not great, but satisfactory. Nevertheless, if it is often used, I suggest using an AC adapter. When the battery starts running, it sounds terrible, but you could put it in bypass mode to end the set. Even if the ""foot switch"" is switched off and the LED is not lit, this thing works as a straight XLR ouput direct box for everything you put in it. One could combine the output of an acoustic electric guitar or the output of an electric guitar pedal laton with this and thus feed a mixer for direct recording, which is a very practical function for the home receiver! Amp emulation and sound control are wrong for anything other than the electric bass, so just use it as a direct box with the sound/emulation circuit switched off for everything but bass. The controls are all rotary buttons except the ground-lift switch, which is a sliding control. The controls on the left to the right, the upper row after the second row are: DRIVE, TREBLE, BASS, LEVEL, PREENCE, GROUND LIFT SLIDE SWITCH and BLEND. It is important to take every control to understand what they are doing, because they are not all logically placed. The DRIVE regulator adjusts the height of the amplification, similar to the control of the inlet stage of the pipe burst, and here you can obtain something like the tonal thickness (or edge) of the overturned pipe tone. This part of the circuit injects variable harmonics and some of the more pleasurable distortions for this purpose. There is no ACTIVE/PASSIVE paddle switch or additional active input lever on this pedal. So if you have an active bass, you do not have to turn the drive button up so much to get the desired sound. The TREBLE button is a + or - 12db push and cut of upper frequency tones. The BASS button is a + or - 12db push and cut of the lower frequencies. 12-clock is flat (or zero db boost or cut) on both the treble and bass buttons. The LEVEL button is the volume control and all it does is control the output volume without tonal colouring. The PRESENCE button increases the upper frequency range for more attack in your tone. The Presence button is not a midrange control, but increases the upper middle legs. The GROUND LIFT switch only works on the XLR output jack and it should remain ""OFF"" unless you hang it up and there are sums. Then you can turn the Ground Lift ""ON"" and it could help eliminate the sum problem. For security reasons, however, it is better to remedy this by eliminating the electrical earthquake that causes the sum. The BLEND button controls the amount of tube emulation that is injected into the pedal output, the whole way to the left is none, twelve is 50% and the whole way clockwise is 100%. Very little bass equipment, or anything else, is today ""PERFECT"". Control equipment generally has more build problems over most of its product line because with Chinese parts and work is how they reduce costs. Developed in Germany, but built in China means that you get Chinese components and Chinese construction quality, while the specifications look quite enticing. For example, during the first battery change, the battery clip destroyed itself, as part of the clamp was attached to the battery, which had been completely removed from the clip. It was a Duracell battery, the standard for pedal batteries. I went to Radio Shack and got replacement battery clips and repaired it with a new clip by soldering wires from the new clip onto the wires that were cut off from the old clip and attached the solder piece. I've never used this as a stompbox before, because the switch looks like it'll break if you lean hard on it. The design is plastic. The housing is very durable, but based on previous experience with plastic switches on stompbox I do not know how to use my size 13-D foot on it. The Treble and Presence buttons in the mine generate hisses and noises when they are set very high, which cannot be found on a vintage type bass amplifier without high toners at all, but flashes when using a full-range amplifier and switch cabinet or when using the XLR output for recording or a PA feed. Basically, I put the step and occurrence at the point where I can hear the hissing begin, then back until it completely goes away, because that is the functional boundary. Hiss is not a problem in bypass mode because the pre-amplifier is disabled. The buoys, except the XLR, are the plastic box buoys that are soldered directly to the PCB of the pedal, these types of buoys are known for problems, especially after rough use, so take it easy with them and they should last very long. This unit does not have its own MIDRANGE button, but the Presence button seems to increase and twist the upper centers simultaneously. Some people who use this pedal as a stage tool use it as a solo or ""Scoop"" switch for clap step solos, so the presence, bass and Treble Boost are basically all you need for a solo switch anyway. PROS: First of all, the price is almost too good to be true when you consider the price for everything else with similar properties, but note that it has sustainability problems, so be careful with it and it will take indefinite time. It's not a Tech 21 NYC Bass Driver, but it works in a similar way to one. I have a Tech 21 Bass Driver Deluxe that I use at Gigs. The Tech 21 sounds better, but costs about eight times as much as the controller. I use the remote at home and keep carrying it on my board at home. If I didn't have the Tech 21 unit, I could take that unit to Gigs, but it's probably gonna take a lot longer than I keep them at home. I especially like this unit when combined with small sample/exercise types. Many of these smaller combos have passive clay circles that are basically flat when the clay is wide open and this device really makes these little amps sound more serious. Part of the beauty of an active bass is t the tone boost ability that you do not get in a passive bass and if you have a passive bass, this can make it sound more like an active bass with the treble and bass boost in front of the amplifier. It is also useful to raise a signal to the backline before a longer cable, say everything about 18-meters. The XLR direct output is very useful for recording and the XLR direct output can also be used to feed the PA at a gig if your amplifier does not have an XLR direct output. How I use this device: I put my bass guitar in the entrance and use the XLR output to connect it to a microphone mixer. The output of the microphone mixer is connected in a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz soundcard in an XP computer. Then I can record the recording software of the computer, practice solo or play with headphones. With headphones, I can play as loud as I want at any time without disturbing anyone. Most computer loudspeakers are very inadequate for the electric bass, so I recommend headphones instead of your typical desktop computer loudspeakers. You can buy better computer loudspeakers that are capable, but they will cost about the same or even more than a decent bass practice combo amplifier. Qualitative headphones cost much less than high-quality computer loudspeakers capable of bass guitar. After I had this pedal for about four years and knew what I knew about it, I'd buy it back. I would strongly recommend it as a home/exercise tool, but my recommendation as a stage tool is not so strong. It's good for home use. You can use it on Gigs, but I'd save Gig Bones to buy something more durable with better performance.",3

2785,"This device works. That's what it does. After inserting the electronic bass into the pedal instrument, insert the second standard instrument cable into the high and low resistance output plug of the pedal, and then insert the cable into the bass amplifier. It can be connected to the low resistance microphone bulb amplifier through the 200 ohm resistance Canon plug. You can only use high and low item output or canon output, or both. When the foot switch is turned off, its function is transparent without any tone change, just like a direct box. When the scaffold switch is turned on, the LED light will be activated to improve the tone and lifebuoy simulation function. I moved it with my fingers, but for my personal purpose, I kept it on, so I put the ""springboard switch"" in quotation marks. Insert the plug into the device, input jack, and the power of the device will be turned on. Therefore, if the battery is used for operation, the input must be deleted when it is not actually used. Its other functionality reviews 9V or 9V power supplies. I used the battery for a while, but replaced it with an AC adapter. The battery life is not too long, but satisfactory. However, if it is often used, it is recommended to use an AC adapter. When the battery starts working, it sounds bad, but in order to complete the setting, it can be set in bypass mode. In addition, when the ""pedal switch"" is off and the LED is not on, the device can be directly used as a direct output box for all items you insert. You can connect the acoustic guitar output or the electric guitar pedal output to it and record directly for the mixer. This is a very convenient function for home recording lovers! Amplifier Analog and tone control are wrong for everything except the front bass, so everything except the bass can be used directly as a speaker and turn off the tone / analog circuit. Except for the ground rise switch used as a sliding switch, the control device is a rotary switch. The control from left to right and from the first row to the second row is mixed with the drive, treble, bass, volume, status, ground rise sliding switch. Because all controls are not in the logical position, control is very important. The adjustment amount of the driving switch is similar to the input level control of the driving bulb amplifier, and the scale thickness (or edge) similar to the driving scale can be obtained. Basically, this part of the circuit is injected with variable common auxiliary wave and more pleasant actual situation. This pedal has no active / manual pad switch or additional active input plug. If there is active bass, you can obtain the necessary tone even if you don't turn the screwdriver up too much. The treble switch is + or - 12dB rising and high-frequency tone cutting. The bass switch can reduce + or - 12 dB rise and low frequency. The treble and bass switches are flat at 12 o'clock. The volume switch is the main volume control, which only controls the output volume without tone coloring. The status switch can increase the content of high-frequency waves and make your tone more aggressive. The status switch is not intermediate control, but it can rise to intermediate control. The ground switch only affects the canon output plug-in. If the connection does not buzz, keep it ""off"". Also, opening the ground lift helps eliminate the buzzing sound. However, from a safety point of view, it is best to solve this problem by eliminating the buzzing electrical grounding circuit conflict. The mixing switch controls the pipeline analog output of the injection pedal. There is no pipeline analog on the left. The pipeline analog at 12 o'clock is 50% and the pipeline analog in the clock direction is 100%. Disadvantages: at present, few bass devices or other devices are perfect. BEHRINGER gear's use of Chinese parts and labor on most product lines is their way to reduce costs, so there are generally more manufacturing problems. Although it is designed in Germany, it is made in China, which means that Chinese parts and construction quality can be obtained. The specifications look quite attractive. For example, when replacing the battery for the first time, part of the terminals of the battery clip are stuck in the battery, and the battery clip is completely removed. Duracell battery, standard composition of pedal battery. Replace the battery clip in the radio room, fix it with a new clip, weld the welding wire of the new clip to the old clip, and wrap the welding spot with adhesive tape. I never used it as a pedal. Because if you press hard, the switch may break. Buildings are all plastic. The shell can be used for a long time, but according to my previous experience of using plastic switches in the roller box, I know that my 13-D size feet should not be used on it. My treble and status switches will make hoarse sound and noise when they are installed very high. This may not be clear at all in old bass amplifiers without tweeters, but it will become dazzling when using power amplifiers and speakers, or when using Canon output recording or sending PA. Basically, I set the treble and status to Shh, and then step back until it disappears completely. Because this is a functional limitation. Since the front amplifier is turned off, hiss has no problem in bypass mode. In addition to canon, Jack is a plastic box Jack directly welding the pedal circuit board. This jack may cause problems, especially after rough use, be careful and use it for a long time. This phone does not have any dedicated midrange switch, but the status switch can increase the midrange and treble at the same time. Some people use this pedal as a stage prop and tap the solo or ""exclusive"" switch. In short, the solo switch can only strengthen the arena, bass and treble. Advantages: first of all, the most important thing is that considering the price of other similar functions, the price is almost too expensive. But because there is a problem with durability, it should be soft. Prices will continue indefinitely. This is not a New York State tech21 bass driver, but works in a similar way. The technology I used in the concert 21 bass drive is very luxurious. Tech21 sounds better, but the price is about 8 times that of BEHRINGER. I put it on the pedal with Bellinger at home. If I don't have tech21 equipment, I can take it to the show, but it may last as long as I leave it at home. I especially like this unit when used in combination with small rehearsals / exercises. Many of these small combinations have circular scale circuits. When the scale is fully turned on, these circuits are basically flat. This device does aggravate the sound of this small amplifier more seriously. Some of the beauty of the main bass is the tone enhancement function that is not available in the manual bass. If you have manual bass, this will make it sound more like active bass. Treble and bass are enhanced in front of the amplifier. In addition, it is also helpful to convey the signal in front of the same length of cable over 18 feet to the back end. It is very useful to record Canon output directly. If the amplifier does not have a direct output canon, the canon direct output can also be used to gig supply power to the PA. How to use this device: plug the bass guitar into the input and connect to the microphone mixer using the canon output. The output of the microphone mixer will be connected to the telwich Santa card of the XP computer. Moreover, I can use the computer recording software to record, or practice solo, or play music recorded with headphones. Because there are headphones, I can play the sound I want at any time, and no one will disturb me. Since most computer speakers are not suitable for bass, I recommend using headphones instead of typical desktop speakers. You can buy better computer speakers, but their price is not different from that of a good bass guitar practice combination amplifier, or even higher. The price of high-quality headphones is much lower than that of high-quality computer speakers supporting bass guitar. I have had this pedal for about four years. If I know it, I will buy it again. I strongly recommend it as a home recording / practice tool, but as a stage tool, my suggestion is not strong. Just use it at home You can use it at concerts",3

2794,"I received this in my email today and plugged it into the pedal before the amplifier. Like other commentators here, I am sad to report that it is quite ""hissing"". I had hoped it wouldn't be a hissing pedal type, but it was. I use Uber metal, boss metal zone, Ibanez La metal and boss compressor / supporter of line 6 and my SKB pedal. There is no noise on the circuit board itself, but when I put the eq700 and other pedals together, there will be an obvious hiss. Although the volume is not large, you can certainly hear the hiss when you turn the amplifier (I use the Peavey special 212 transtube combination) above 4. I'm not sure if the noise door pedal can reduce the noise, but I'm going to try danaectro Fish & chips (recommended by another critic). I'm waiting for the arrival of the Bellinger Orchestra Choir, hoping it won't hiss like the eq700. I would say, although I like the tone influence of this pedal. It does a good job of changing the pitch & providing more sound flexibility for my equipment. In general, I give this pedal three of the five stars.",3
2795,"I received this by email today. I plugged it into the pedal in front of the amplifier. Like other commentators here, I regret to point out that he is quite ""out of breath"".

I'm not sure if noisy door pedals can reduce noise, but I'll try Danae electro Fish & chips (recommended by another critic). I'm waiting for the Bellinger Orchestra Choir, hoping they won't whistle like eq700. What I want to say is, although I like the gay tone. It's good at changing the tone & it gives my device more sound flexibility. Overall, I give this pedal three fifths of the stars.",3
2796,"I got this in mail today and plugged it into my pedal board just before the amp. Like other critics here, I'm sad to report it's totally 'hissy'. Hope you like it. I am using the sixth metal, boss metal belt, Ibanez La metal and boss compressor / sustainer with my SKB pedal board. While the board itself is not noisy at any of the other pedal crank, I don't have much of a low volume when I put eq700 with others, but you're an amplifier (I use Peavey special 212 transtube combo) There are significant hiscs when crank. I don't know if the noise gate pedal will reduce this, but I'm going to try dunaelectrical Fish & chips, recommended by another reviewer. I arrive and wait for the BEHRINGER Orchestra Chorus pedal that is not hissy like eq700. I like the effect of the tone this pedal has, but I'll say. It gives a good job of changing tones & gives flexibility for my rig sound. Overall I give this pedal 3 out of 5 stars.",3
2797,"I received this at the post office today and put it on the pedal in front of the amplifier. Like other commentators here, I regret to report that this is quite ""hissing"". I hope it won't be like a hissing pedal, but it is. I used the compressor / support devices of Uber metal, boss metal zone, Ibanez La metal and boss, as well as my SKB pedal. The circuit board itself will not make noise, but when I insert the eq700 with other pedals, it will obviously hiss. Although it is not very loud, when you switch the amplifier (I use the Peavey special 212 transtube combination) It's after 4 o'clock. You're sure to hear a hiss.

I'm waiting for the arrival of the Belings choir, hoping it won't hiss like the eq700. I would say, although I like the sound of the pedal. It handles tonal changes very well, & providing greater sound flexibility for my device. In short, I gave three of the five stars on the pedal.",3

I was hoping it wouldn't be a hissing pedal, but it is. I use a line 6-Uber Metal, Boss Metal Zone, Ibanez LA Metal, Boss Compressor/Sustainer with my SKB pedal. The board itself is not noisy at all with one of the other pedals connected but when I enter the EQ700 with the others, there is a noticeable hissing, though not so much at low volume, but if you use the amplifier (I use a Peavey Special 212 Transtube combo above 4, you can definitely hear the hissing. I'm not sure if a sound port would pedal this down, but I'm going to the Danaelectro Fish Chips (as recommended by another reviewer) I am waiting for the Behringer Orchestra Chorus pedal to arrive and I hope it is not sizzling like the EQ700.

I used Uber metal, boss metal area, Ivans La metal and boss compressor / strut of line 6, and my SKB pedal. The circuit board itself does not make any noise, but if the EQ 700 is placed together with other pedals, it will make an obvious hiss. Although the volume is not large, if you turn the amplifier (I use the Peavey special 212 transtube combination) above 4, you will hear the sound of Shh. I don't know if the noise pedal can reduce the noise, but I want to try danaelo Fish & chips. I hope the Bellinger Orchestra Choir doesn't come as easily as EQ 700. Although I like the tone of this pedal to have an impact, I want to say. It changes the tone well and provides greater sound flexibility for my device.

Bellinger thought there was something wrong with the hoarseness of their products, but he didn't know why. But once a sound is made, it is difficult to distinguish the sound of Shh. It's not very noisy and annoying There? Anyway, it's a cheap unit. It can not only complete this work, but also work normally in most cases where such equipment is needed (such as manual pickup and non powered audio equipment). I recommend it to people who need it. Because it is relatively easy to use (springboard switch) and relatively low cost. My prediction is only general, but in some cases, general is enough",3

2895,"I bought this pedal years ago and, like most guitarists who buy new equipment, I have fallen victim to CONFIRMATION BIAS in terms of the criticism I gave to my musicians'friends. front, the pedal sounds great. In the shop, when you disassemble this pedal, you will quickly be able to pick up on which distortion you prefer... But over time you will be very frustrated by the actual tone of distortion itself. Turn one of the buttons after twelve, and you will get some unwanted nasal/hissy/tinny frequencies that require compression, noise Gating and EQ to tame. The """""""", Top Boost&""returns what it displays, but if the pedal itself is already dimebagbed and you get the Top Boost... It sounds strange and unmusical. Electro Harmonix is a great pedal manufacturer, but I think they've overstepped their bounds. Where is this pedal now in my collection? Sold for cash. After I decided to bite the silver bullet and buy a BOSS ME-70 multi-effects to simplify my Gigging setup, I found it as beautiful as it is to have an analog distortion like the metal muff, it would never compete with the digital distortion on board the ME-70... Boy, I was wrong. After the ME-70 I did an A/B test and the ME-70 took the gold home easily. It wasn't a surprise... Both BOSS and MXR are respected manufacturers when it comes to noise disturbances. What would I recommend? That depends. If you're in a metal band and you're recording an EP, in my opinion, there's no pedal anywhere near a fully curved tube amplifier distortion. However, if your amplifier does not have a good distortion channel or ability, then a conservative (and affordable) BOSS DS-1 for a more musical metal tone. The reality is, most manufacturers have great distortion pedals, so it really depends on your subjective standards of sound... since no two distortions sound alike. Personally, I recommend the MXR Fulbore Metal... I wish I'd bought the pedal instead of the metal muff. The Noise Gate and Mid Scooper switches are much better pedal accessories than a top boom. The Fulbore also has a Mid Frequency... which can dramatically influence the overall impression.",3
2896,"I bought this pedal years ago, and like most guitarists who buy new equipment, I fell victim to CONFIRMATION BIAS about the criticism I gave to my musical friends. The pedal sounds great. At the store, if you break that pedal, you'll be able to quickly enter any distortion you prefer... But in time, you'll be disappointed in the true tone of deformation. Turn any of the buttons over the 12-year-old, and you'll get some unwanted nasal, crawling/melancholy frequencies that require compression, noise, and EQ to help yourself. It provides everything it advertises, but if the pedal itself is already broken and you get involved with the Top Boost... It just sounds weird and useless. Electro Harmonix is a great pedal manufacturer, but I think they crossed the line with it. Where is this pental in my collection now? Sold for cash. After I decided to bite the silver bullet and buy a BOSS ME-70 Multi-Effects to simplify my operation, I thought that as nice as it is to have a Metal Deformation, Like the Metal Muff, it could never compete with the digital broadcast on the ME-70... My child, I was wrong. After I took the ME-70, I took an A/B test and the ME-70 took the gold home easily. That wasn't a surprise. Since both BOSS and MXR are respected manufacturers with regard to distortion sounds. What would I suggest you buy? That depends. If you're in a metal zone, and you're recording an EP, none of the pedals in my opinion come close to a complete eccentric tube-wine distortion. However, if your amplifier does not have a good deformation channel or ability, then a more conservative (and accessible) BOSS DS-1 for a more musical metal tone. The reality is, most manufacturers have large deformation pedals, so it really depends on your subjective standards for tuna... Because the two distortions don't sound the same. Personally, I recommend MXR Fullbore Metal... The pedal I wish I'd bought instead of the Metal Muff. Noise switches and middle staircase are much better pedal parts than a Top Boost. The proxy also has a middle frequency dial button... which can dramatically shape the overall sound.",3
2897,"I bought this pedal a few years ago, and like most guitarists who buy new equipment, my musician friends are influenced by confirmation bias in their comments. The front pedal sounds good. In the store, if you demonstrate this pedal, you will soon focus on any mistakes you like. But over time, you will be disappointed with the actual tone of the distortion itself. Turning a switch for more than 12 can obtain unnecessary nasal sound / Shh sound / small frequency, compression, noise gate and EQ control. Article 34 Push away & 34; It does provide its publicity, but the pedal itself goes into the pocket. If the supercharger on the top is used It sounds strange and not musical. Electro Harmonix is a great pedal manufacturer, but I think they have gone beyond the boundaries of this manufacturer. Which pedal is in my collection now? Sell now Clench your teeth and decide to buy boss me-70 multi effects. After simplifying my gging settings, I think it's better to have simulation errors like a metal plug. This will never compete with the digital error of the me-70. I was wrong. Took me-70 and did a / B test. Me-70 easily won the gold medal This is not surprising Considering that boss and MXR are respected manufacturers in spirit, what do you want to buy? It depends. If you record EP on metal tape, in my opinion, the pedal is not close to a completely curved pipe amplifier. But if your amplifier doesn't have a channel or ability to work properly, the more conservative and more affordable boss DS-1 is a more metallic tone of music. In fact, most manufacturers have the wrong pedal, which actually depends on your subjective standard of tone. Because there is no two kinds of authenticity, it sounds exactly the same. I personally recommend MXR professional metal I hope I didn't buy a metal plug, but a pedal. The muffler and pedal switch are better pedal elements than the top supercharger. The overall diameter also has a medium wave shaping switch. It can dramatically shape the whole sound.",3

2946,"Boss AC-3 is a repairable Acoustic Simulator. I am the only guitarist. In my playing environment (children's Church), I often need to switch back and forth between acoustics and electricity. AC3 completed this work. Although it has several modes, the giant mode seems to be the most useful. Through a carefully balanced amplifier, you can get a tone equivalent to plug-in acousto electricity, with a very bright setting. There is an audible hiss, which is not obvious when directly inserting the PA, obvious when inserting a good and clean tube amplifier, and out of control when using Humbuckers or solid state. The correct use of this pedal is the key to the use of this pedal. First, use a single coil. Tested professionally with Les Paul and basbuck, the boos were overwhelming. Compared with the American luxury strat game, N3 noiseless dog ranks third. It performs very well on the crystal clean channel. Second point - any form of gain will produce a lot of hiss. The performance of point three transistor amplifier is much better than that of solid-state amplifier (tested by frontman 212 and vox Pathfinder with orange micro terror and fender HRD). AC3 is not a pedal to ignore. Depending on the volume of the amplifier and your room, you need to carefully check the EQ to find the tone.

2947,"The AC-3 boss is an available acoustic simulator. I am the only guitarist. In my game environment (children's Church), I often need to switch back and forth between acoustics and electricity. AC3 completed work. Although there are several modes, the giant mode seems to be the most useful. With a carefully balanced amplifier, you can get a tone equivalent to acoustic and plug-in power, very bright setting. When inserting PA directly, there is a hissing sound, which is not obvious. When inserting a clean tube amplifier, it is obvious that it is out of control when using Humbuckers or solid state. Proper use of this pedal is essential for its use. First, use a single coil. Tested with Paul and basbuck professionals, ridicule is overwhelming. In the American luxury stratum game, N3 noiseless dog ranked third and did well on the crystal cleaning channel. Second, any gain will produce a lot of hiss. The performance of the three tube point amplifier is much better than that of the solid-state amplifier (tested by frontman 212 and vox Pathfinder with orange Mini terror and fender HRD). AC3 is not a neglected pedal. Depending on the volume of the amplifier and your room, you need to carefully check EQ to determine the tone.

Carefully played through the EQ amplifier, you can get a tone comparable to the sound that is connected with the acoustic electric in a very bright setting. There is an unheard of hiss. And directly connected to a more prominent pa. And connected to a nice, clean tube amp to stand up. The key to use this pedal is using it correctly. First of all: use a single Coyle. Tested in Les Paul with burstbucker pro's, hiss was overwhelming. Played with an American Deluxe strat with N3 noiseless pubs at the 3rd position, it actually performed very well in the crystal clean channel. Point 2 - create a ton of tons of gain for any form. Point 3 - tube amp is performed infinitely more than a solid state amplifier. The AC3 is not set but it forgets to pedal it. Based on the amplifier and the volume of the room you're doing, you need to make the tweek EQ to find that sound. I've read you can use EQ pedals to get the same tone, I don't discover that it's a case.

3150,"I bought this compressor pedal out of a mood. I took a look at some more beautiful ones and decided to try it just for $20. It came in the mail today, and I was surprised that the basic equipment of the packaging. Very few instructions, actually. This is NOT to be sent with a 9-Volt battery, and putting one in yourself is a kind of pain to change, as you have to get a Phillips screwdriver and screw four corner screws on your back to do this. (wish there was a plastic back, or thumb screwdriver option)This pedal is really quiet, and not in a good way. Do not expect to increase your signal by using the make-up Gain/Output button all the way up and the sensitivity all the way down, it was about the same volume as the original signal, just a little louder. He didn't seem to be a sound recorder in the chain when he was off. Most compressors add a little noise or hiss when they are switched on because of the way the noise level is raised. It also has a SUBSTANTIAL treble boost/low cut going forward. Even if the sensitivity button is at the bottom, it kills your low end. It sounds pretty bright. With what is said, it works wonders on single-string/double-stop things on the already three-track things that are played on the G, B and E strings, and makes them sound tight and full. It seems to be quite durable, the case is not made of cheap plastic, which is a good thing. Although not as robust as some of the other pedals I'd own. The switch and the inputs seem a bit cheap, provided it was a $20 pedal. I have the feeling that this pedal on tour might be a bad idea, but for home/non-everyday use I could see that it takes a while. The LED is really bright. Almost so bright that if you want to adjust the controls, it makes it a little difficult to see what you're doing. All in all, if you are looking for a cheap compressor to strengthen your tapes and give them an extra punch, this can be the pedal for you, especially if you only have $20. If you are looking for a warm, full-bodied compressor, this is not the choice for you. You really should wait and get the MXR Dyna Comp for just a few more dollars.",3
3151,"I bought this compressor pedal out of a whim. I was looking at something more beautiful, and I decided to make an effort just for twenty dollars. He came in the mail today, and he was surprised at the basic quality of the packaging. Very few instructions actually. That doesn't carry a nine-volt battery, and putting one on yourself is kind of painful to change, as you have to take a friendly screwdriver and twist four corners of your back to do it. (I wish there was a plastic back, or a thumb screw option) This pedal is really quiet, and not in a good way. Don't expect to raise your signal level with this, with the makeup/exit button up to the sensitivity down, it was about the same intensity as the original signal, Just a little louder. Doesn't seem to be a sonic blower in the chain or adding noise when it's off. Most compressors add a little noise or whistles when they work, due to the nature of the increase in noise. It also has a stable triple thrust/low cut. Even with the sensitivity button down, it kills your lower limb. It's loud enough to hear. In these words, it does miracles on a single string/double stop things for the already terrible things playing on the G, B, and E strings, and it makes them sound tight and full. It seems pretty resilient, the case isn't made of cheap plastic, which is good. Though not as hard as some of the other pedals I'll own. The switch and the inputs look a little cheap, though, since it was a quarter of a 20-dollar bill. I feel like using this pedal on a tour might be a bad idea, but for domestic/non-daily use, I could watch it last a while. The LED is very bright. Almost so bright, when you're trying to adjust the controls, it makes it kind of hard to see what you're doing. Generally, if you're looking for a cheap compressor to strengthen your strings and give them some extra punch, this can be the pedal for you, especially if you only have $20.

3152,"I bought this compressor pedal with great interest. I saw something better and decided to pay only $20. That's from today. I was surprised at the basic quality of the packaging. In fact, there are few instructions. This is not a 9 volt battery. Make yourself miserable. Because you have to screw the Philips screws and the back of the four screws like this. This pedal is so quiet. It's not a good idea. Don't expect it to improve your signal level. The makeup gain / output switch continues upward and the sensitivity is downward. Its volume is not much different from the original signal, only a little noise. It doesn't seem to be a sound absorber for a chain. Add noise when off. Most compressors will increase some noise or rest sound when working, because the noise floor will rise. Moreover, substantial 3x up / down cuts are under way. Even if the sensor switch continues to go down, it will be pressed lower. have good ears and eyes Nevertheless, the high pitched single string / two-point music played in counties g, B and e played a magical role, allowing them to listen carefully and fully. It looks really durable. It's a good thing that the box is not made of cheap plastic. Although not as strong as my pedals. Although it's a $20 pedal, the switch and input seem a little cheap. I know it may not be a good idea to use this pedal during travel, but it may last for some time for family / non daily use. The LED is really bright It's hard to see what you're doing when you want to adjust control. In short, if you are looking for a cheap compressor to increase the treble and bring them extra impact, this may be your pedal. Especially if you only have $20. If you are looking for a warm Telecom compressor, this is not your choice. You really should wait a while. You can buy MXR dyna cop for a few more dollars.",3

3384,"This Behringer DD400 delay unit has many great features. I particularly like the stereo outputs that allow the user to send the delayed signal to a separate amplifier in order to achieve a dramatic stereo effect. The extra long 1300 millisecond delay is ideal for Pink Floyd/David Gilmour style Soli. The shorter delay settings allow rockabilly hit back effects, although I hardly play in this style, so it's not so important to me. Here's where it gets weird: I tested the device with a vintage Fender tube amplifier for the primary signal and a Vox Valvestate amplifier for the delayed signal. As long as I played loud, everything worked pretty well. But when I put the guitar down for a moment, I heard voices. Yes, voices! The delay unit received radio frequency disturbances a la Jimi Hendrix in Berkeley. I have no idea what that was like, but I could hear some kind of radio transmission like CB or family band radio. The disturbance disappeared after a few minutes. As far as design is concerned, I am not buying Behringer's ""German Innovation"" advertising line.

3385,"This Behringer DD400 delay unit has many great features. I particularly like stereo systems that allow the user to send the delayed signal to a separate amplifier for a dramatic stereophonic effect. The additional large 1300-millisecond delay is large for Pink Floyd/David Gilmur solos. The shorter delay settings allow rock back effects, although I rarely play in that style, so it doesn't really matter to me. Here's where it gets weird: I tried the unit using an old Fender tube amplifier for the primary signal and a Vox Valvestate amplifier for the delayed signal. As loud as I played, everything was going really well. However, when I put the guitar down for a moment, I started hearing voices. Yes, voices! The delay unit detected radio interference at La Jimmy Hendrix in Berkeley. I have no idea how he did that, but I could clearly hear some kind of radio transmission like CB or a family radio band. The interference went off after a few minutes. As for planning, I'm not buying the ""German Innovation"" commercial line from Behringer.

3386,"This Bellinger DD 400 delay unit has good characteristics. In order to achieve dramatic stereo effects, I especially like stereo output, allowing users to send the delay signal as a separate amplifier. Pink Floyd / David Gilmour style solo likes a long delay of 1300 milliseconds. A short delay setting can achieve a rock like counterattack effect. Although I rarely do that style, it doesn't matter to me. This is what makes it strange. The unit I tested used the main signal of the old mud diaphragm tube amplifier and the delay signal of the vox valvestate amplifier. As long as I play loudly, everything goes well. But when I temporarily put down my guitar, I began to hear sound. Yes, my voice! The delay device is subject to frequency interference in La Jimi Hendrix in Berkeley. I don't know how it does this. Any wireless transmission such as CB or home radio can be heard clearly. After a few minutes, the interference disappeared. About design, I don't buy his innovative advertisement in Germany. This is clearly a cheap Chinese version of the legendary big brother dd-7, and the price is four times that of it. If you really want a good quality, please buy the management department. If you can buy a fairly cheap time delay device, it will sometimes talk to you. Then Bellinger will do.",3

3842,"I bought one a few years ago. I use it to connect my Bellinger bcr2000. (in MIDI mode, of course!) Mix the Reaper's tasks into my computer. That's no problem. I didn't complain. Because I stopped working a few weeks ago (I think the USB interface is bent, so this is the culprit), so I bought another one. There was no problem when the replacement arrived and installed, but MIDI data could not be sent to the computer. Just take the MIDI out of the computer and give it to Bellinger Perhaps because of the adapter or the recent popular windows update, but this is not ideal. (although I saw the normal installation in my busy schedule, I didn't try to use it, so I threw the package away. Unfortunately, the replaced device has the same symptoms as the first device, so now it seems to be hanging on two USB / MIDI interfaces that may be damaged. I newly installed windows, Uninstall and reinstall both from another computer.) Driver, although it counts all kinds of good things, none of them can send MIDI data to the computer. I almost threw away my BEHRINGER device. Because I think it's also out of order. What a blessing. I tried an old linen base, which was also good. This means that as long as I get and buy MIDI cables, I can start working again. So, I'll tell you, I'll buy it before I throw it away. When you can use it, they are absolutely excellent and very cheap. If you receive a lemon, give it back to me and order another one. If you don't worry, it's worth it. If you are in a hurry, I would suggest you order some or buy something else. E MIDI latency reporting for these devices may be inappropriate. Through this device, the speed of transmitting MIDI data to the computer is faster than expected, but the delay actually experienced is the delay of converting MIDI data into audio. This delay occurs inside the computer and will not occur. Hum * * related to the performance of the equipment. This depends on the hardware and software configuration. All discussions about ASIO are only helpful for audio. There will be no problem recording MIDI data with this device. If there is a functioning device!: -) Cheers.",3

3987,"I agree with other comments that the boss uses his customers to insist that the $300 pedal is supplied with PSA, but sold separately. This is a vulgar way to reach the price point without doing it. I used a single point power supply I already had, and it worked well. I'm glad I don't have to pay my boss an extra $20 for what they should provide me. The first thing I noticed was that the tuner was not very good. You will receive a letter with an arrow on each side, but it is not very responsive. Korg style dial in reverberation control is simple, but very limited. I hope it's better. You have a room and a hall. Neither is realistic. Moving from manual patch level to bank level is embarrassing. This may require practice. Next, I noticed that the latency level did not respond as expected. If I set the E. level (delay signal level, or balance) to about 30, I can hear it clearly. When the overdrive or boost is increased, the main signal is boosted as expected, but the delay signal remains at the original volume, effectively reducing the balance and making the delay signal almost inaudible. Has the boss just started making multi effect pedals? Didn't they learn anything? Although the performance and design of me70 are mediocre, it does have recommended functions. Some drives are available. The control device is easy to access and adjust. The ""solo"" setting on the comp / FX module is a good booster. Although the booster in the OD / DS module is easy to over drive - maybe this is design, it would be good if there were two levels of cleaning booster. The next worry is that the function of the optional foot switch is very limited. I want to be able to switch between preset and manual settings, but all it does is turn the preamplifier on and off, or step (unidirectional) through the gift (fs-5u). It almost seems that the boss has very cynically weakened the me70, so it does not threaten gt10 sales. I look forward to learning more about this pedal. So far, it has done some good things, but it may be better. Has anyone noticed that the comments of me70 are not very useful? I want to see the predecessor of VOx tonelab. Now it has been bombed. For example, Ge 225 -- 3 / 16 / 12 update: Despite the above limitations, I still like the portability of this unit. It runs on six AA's (I think) which is great when you just want to put it on the floor to play, for example, in a jam, you don't have power nearby. New failed update - the vibrato of this unit stinks. I mean smelly. No matter what the ""waveform"" is, it is not a sine wave and is not smooth at all. Very bad musical features. No matter which engineer is in charge of it, you've screwed up. Your own boss's vibrato pedal is much better than the one you put on the me70. Why did you do that, boss?

The first thing I noticed was that the tuner was not very good. You will receive a letter with arrows on both sides, but it doesn't react very quickly. Korg style reverberation control is simple, but very limited. I hope it's better. You have a room and a hall. Neither is realistic. Upgrading from manual patch level to bank level is troublesome. This may require practice. Then I noticed that the latency level did not respond as expected. If I set the E level (delay signal level, or balance) to about 30, I will hear it clearly. When the overspeed or boost increases, the main signal is boosted as expected, but the delay signal remains at the original volume, effectively reducing the balance and making the delay signal almost inaudible. The boss just started to step on the multi-function pedal? They didn't learn anything? Although the performance and design of the me70 are a little poor, it has a recommended function. Some drives are available. Control is easy to access and adjust. The ""solo"" setting on the comp / FX module is a good supercharger. Although the supercharger in the OD / DS module can easily overload it - perhaps it is designed, it would be great if there were two clean supercharger levels. The next problem is that the function of the optional foot switch is very limited. I wish I could switch from preset to manual setting, but all it does is turn on and off the preamplifier, or take a step in the gift (fs-5u) (unidirectional).

It's like jam. You have no power nearby. New update failed - trill for this pue unit. It smells bad. No matter what the waveform is, it is not sinusoidal and completely unsmooth. Very bad musical features. Whoever's in charge, you're ruined. Your boss's Trill pedal is much better than yours on the me70. Why did you do that, boss? I like vibration, but it doesn't work in this unit. Some people won't notice this, but if you like chatting in the swamp, you will be very disappointed.",3
3989,"I agree to the other check that the boss will use that customer by claiming that the $300 pedal has a PSA supply, but separately sell it. It's really cheapest way to meet price points without doing it. I already used onepot power and it works well. Just be glad that I didn't have to put a boss $20 or more into the shell for something I had to offer me70. First notice is that the tuner is not very good. You get the letters by each side arrow and it's not very responsive. The rob control's Korg style dial is simple but very limited. Better predict you get either room or hole. Both are realistic. It is troublesome to go to the bank level from the manual patch level. It may just take practice. Next, the delay level does not react as expected. It can sound clear if I set E level (delay signal level, or balance) around 30 o'clock. When overdrive or boost is applied, the primary signal is boosted as expected. However, the delay signal remains the original volume. And effectively reduce the balance and make the delay signal substantially audible. Boss just start making multi effect pedal? Have they learned anything? Despite some plain performance and design, me70 has the features to recommend it. Some drives are available. Controls are accessible and easy to adjust. The ""solo"" setting of the comp / FX module is a good booster, but it can be easily overridden by boost with the OD / DS module - maybe this is due to design, but it can be It would be nice to have two levels of clean boost. The next discomfort is the very limited ability of the optional footswitch. I was hoping to flip between presets and manual settings, but it is all the preamp turned on or off (step fs-5u) via the present (one way). It has hardly threatened the gt10 sales because the boss paralyzed me70 very calmly. I am looking forward to learn more about this pedal. So far, do some good things, but it may be far better. Did anyone else notice me70 reviews that aren't too handy? I am thinking of checking out vox tonelab ex. And it is currently being blown away at 225gc, for example 3 / 16 / 12 update: Despite the above restrictions, I like this unit portability. It runs on 6 AA (I want you to put it on the floor just and play), for example, with jam that doesn't have the power close to you. New failure update - this unit tremolo just smells. I mean bad smell. What's ""waveform"", it's not a sine wave, not smooth. Celebrity of very poor music. Even if the engineer was in charge of this, you threw a big time. Your own boss tremolo pedal is much better than what you put in me70. Why would you do it, boss? I like tremolo but it is virtually useless in this unit. Some people will not be notified, but you will be very disappointed if you like that damp fender style tremolo.",3
3990,"I agree with other comments that the boss uses his customers to deduct $300 within a month. This is a vulgar way to do nothing to reach the price point. I use an energy source that I already have, and it works well. I'm glad I won't pay the boss $20 for what they should give me. The first thing I noticed was not a good regulator. You will receive a letter with arrows on both sides, but the answer is not strong. Korg's reverberation translation style is very simple, but very limited. I hope it will be better. You have a room and a hall. Neither is true. The transition from manual patch level to bank level is very embarrassing. This may require exercise. I further pointed out that the degree of delay did not meet expectations. Level E (delay signal or balance level) is set at about 30 and can be heard clearly. When the transistor is amplified or boosted, the main boost signal, but the delay signal remains at the original volume, This effectively reduces the balance so that the delay signal is almost invisible. The boss just started making pedals? They didn't learn anything? Although the performance and design of me70 are mediocre, it does have recommended functions. Some drives are available.

The new update error is the smelly vibrato of this cell. I mean, it smells. Whatever it is, ""shape"" is not a sine wave and is not flat at all. A very bad musical character.

The string movement is very low, which is very suitable for fast playing mode. Even for the soprano Quartet, the pitch of the song has little continuity, which is very real for those who want a more ""Hawaiian"" sound, but this small sound and low persistence make it difficult to play with other instruments unless a microphone is used. The worst side of the four string harp is the string. It needs to stretch the strings forever or interrupt the strings. That means you have to adjust your four string instrument after each song, so people who begin playing the four string violin should remember to use the halftone tuner. Use the first FRET chord, such as F and sound distorted for some reason. Replacing the included string with aqila string makes ukulele better, but the increased cost puts it within the price range of ukulele, Lanikai lu-11, which I think is a real beginner. The attached luggage bag is almost useless. It has no filler at all and is very tight. In short, its low price and unique treble ""Hawaii"" make up for its shortcomings. I don't recommend this four string as your only four string, or even the first four string, because the problem of rubbing the chord for the first time will train your ears in the wrong way.

Then I saw this... Use the knob! I have done a lot of research, and I am in a dilemma between rp255 and rp355. I decided to make it cheaper and got rp255. So far, this is a good decision. Rp255 has many functions and is a good compromise between menu and knob. I suggest you review the manual on the first or second day of induction training. To quickly summarize, rp255 may be able to produce any sound or effect you want, but you may need to use it.

These are mirrored by 60 ""user defined"" profiles that are the same as the factory preset. The difference is that #1-60 it can be modified by the user or kept as is. The factory preset value #61-120 cannot be modified. Therefore, you can really try different settings without worrying about losing the content provided by the factory. You can also ""reset"" the entire device if you like, but if you do, you will lose all modifications. In addition to all the different tones and effects provided by this unit, there are two additional functions that are very useful: a (quite basic) drum machine and a 20 second looper. The looper is why I bought this pedal. It's easy to use and overused. I just hope DIGITECH can make it into a 40 second or 60 second looper. 20 seconds is really not much. For reference only, you can't use drummer and looper at the same time. It's no big deal to me. OK, all this is good, so why am I disappointed in this unit? It's simple. I'm an old guy. I've been playing for about 50 years. I have played all kinds of music, and I would appreciate it if I could have a wider range of preset options. This may be a bit exaggerated, but it seems that 95% of the presets are some kind of (annoying) distortion. Guys, not all customers are 13 years old!

For reference, you cannot use drummer and looper at the same time. Big biggie for me. Hope you like it. Quite simple. I am an older person and play for about 50 years. I played all kinds of music and I rated a wider selection of presets. This may be a slight exageration, but 95% of the preset seems to be some sort of (unpleasant) distortion.

For your information, you can't use the drummer and the lute at the same time. No problem for me. Okay, that's all good, so why am I disappointed in this unit? Very simple. I'm an older m, who plays for about fifty years. I have played every music there is, and I would have appreciated a much broader selection of presets. This may be a small exaggeration, but it seems that 95% of the presets are a kind of (unpleasant) distortion. Come on, guys, not all your customers are thirteen years old! I expect a professional device to offer a variety of professional choices. Now I have to work out all my own presets. I'm back in programming menu s, so that's it. It is a solid equipment, with too many young displays to choose from. Frankly, if I had been aware of this, I probably would not have received this unit, despite its good design and quality.",3
4048,"I've had multiple power pedals in the past, even a digital tech. So far they all had one thing in common: menu layers to click through to make changes or adjustments. It was a pain. Then I saw this... My KNOBS! I've been doing a lot of research and I've been torn between the RP255 and the RP355. I decided to go cheap and got the RP255. So far, it's been a good decision. The RP255 has many features and is a good compromise between menus and buttons. I recommend you check the manual for your first day or two orientations. To sum up the device quickly, the RP255 is likely to be able to produce any sound or effect you want, but you may need to work on it. As with many multi-effect pedals, there is a selection of (60) working-side sound/effect profiles to save you the difficulty of programming new ones. These are mirrored by 60 ""user-defined"" profiles that are identical to the workshop sets. The difference is that \-351-60 can be modified by the user, or left as-is. The factory presents, ""-35; 61-120, are not modifiable. So you can really experiment with different sets without thinking about what came out of the factory. You can also""reset the entire device"" ""if you want to, but if you do, you lose all your modifications. In addition to the different sounds and effects that this unit has to offer, there are also two additional features that are very useful: a (quite simple) drum machine and a 20-second loop. The Looper is really the reason I bought this pedal. It's easy to operate and it's spinning. I just wish Digitech had turned it into a 40-60 second loop. 20-seconds really isn't much. For your information, you can't use the drummer and the looper at the same time. Okay, everything's fine, so why am I disappointed in this unit? Simple as that. I'm an older guy who's been playing for about fifty years. I've played all kinds of music, and I would have appreciated a much broader selection of presets. This may be a slight violation, but it seems that 95% of the presets are a kind of (disgusting) distortion. Come on, guys, not all your customers are 13-year-old! I expect a professional device to offer a variety of professional choices. Now I have to work out my own presets. I'm back programming menus, oh!. That's it, then. It's a solid device, with too many teenage tones to choose from. To be honest, if I'd known that, I probably wouldn't have gotten this unit, despite its good design and quality.",3
4049,"I've had five dozen multiple effects in the past, even a Digitech. Until now, everyone had one thing in common: menu layers to press the button to make any changes or adjustments. It was a pain. Then I saw this... with Knobs! I did a lot of research, and I cut myself between RP255 and RP355. I decided to go cheap and I got the RP255. So far, that was a good decision. RP255 has many features, and is a good compromise between menu and button. I suggest you review the manual for your first day or two orientations. To summarise the device quickly, RP255 is likely to produce any sound or effect you wish, but you may need to work on it. As with many five-fold effects, there is a choice (60) of factory tone/effect profile to save you the trouble of planning new ones. These are reflected in a 60-gauge ""user-defined"" profile, which is identical to the factory presets. The difference is that To35.1-60 can be modified by the user, or remain as it is. The factory presets, 35; 61-120, cannot be changed. So you can experiment with different traps without worrying about losing what came from the factory. You can also restore the entire device if you want, but if you do, you will lose all your modifications. In addition to all the different shades and effects offered by this unit, there are also two additional features that are very useful: Drums and a 20second loop. The loop is the reason I bought this pedal. It's easy to use, and he's overreacting. I wish Digtec could do it a 40-or 60-second Luper. Twenty seconds isn't much. Just so you know, you can't use the drummer and the loop at the same time. It's okay with me. Okay, this is all good, so why am I disappointed in this unit? It's very simple. I'm an older guy who's been playing for about fifty years. I've played every kind of music there is, and I would appreciate a much wider selection of presets. This may be a slight exaggeration, but it seems that 95% of the forecasts are some kind of (abhorrent) distortion. Come on, guys, not all your clients are 13-year-olds! I expect a professional piece of equipment to offer a variety of professional options. Now, I'm dealing with processing all my own presets. I'm back in menu programming again, ugh!. So that's it. It's a solid piece of equipment, with lots of child-tone presets to choose from. Frankly, if I'd known that, I probably wouldn't have taken this unit, despite its good design and quality.",3
4050,"I used to have several multifunctional pedals, including didek. So far, what they have in common is to click on the menu layer to make any changes or adjustments. This is a pain. Then I saw this. Use the switch. I've done a lot of research, but it's embarrassing between RP 255 and RP 355. I decided to make it cheaper and got rp255. So far, this is a good decision. Rp255 has multiple functions and is a compromise between menu and switch. It is recommended to review the manual on the first or second day of induction training. To sum up, RP 255 can produce the desired sound or effect, but it can also be used. Like many multi effect pedals, in order to eliminate the trouble of programming new settings, you can select (60) factory sound effect setting files. These profiles are mirrored into 60 custom profiles, the same as the default settings# 1-60 different from the user, it can be modified or kept unchanged. The default setting #61-120 cannot be modified. Therefore, you don't have to worry about losing the content provided by the factory, and you can really try other settings. ""If you like, you can"" reconfigure ""the entire device, but doing so will lose all modifications."" In addition to all the different tones and effects, this unit provides two additional functions. This is very useful. One is a (fairly basic) drum frame and one is a 20 second plug. The plug is why I bought this pedal. It is not only convenient to use, but also overused. I just hope DIGITECH can make it into a 40 second or 60 second plug. 20 seconds is really not much. As a reference, rollers and plugs cannot be used at the same time. It's nothing to me. Well, all this is good. Why am I disappointed with this member? It's simple. I'm an old man. I've been arguing for about fifty years. I have played all kinds of music, and I would appreciate it if there are more extensive presets. This may be a bit exaggerated, but 95% of the settings are an annoying mistake. Shop assistants, not all customers are 13 years old! I hope professional equipment can provide a variety of professional options. Now I'm facing all my preparations. I went back to the programming menu. Ah! This is a very strong device for teenagers to choose tones. To be honest, if I know this, although I am a good design and quality, I can't get this unit.",3

I haven't mastered it yet. A month later, I just knocked and solved. The sound is acceptable, but it is far from ideal. I've seen simpler software that displays all the effects on the screen in the form of stamping box graphics, and you can make sound. With X-EDIT, you can call up a fixed sound and start changing it.

I was afraid I was gonna break a pot or something while I was playing it. The casing is metal, but it looks like the thinnest metal they could get away with building it. The power switch and the chorus/vibrator switch were clearly the cheapest switches they could find, and they're not so easily accessible by a finger... You have to bend over and turn them around. They're small. On the other hand, it was only sixty-nine dollars, relatively cheap for a fifth of multiple functions. I'm not interested in the back looking up, the entrance, the exit and the electric levers. That's not friendly to the pedal in my opinion. Good as a table result. The footprint is quite large in the table about 7.75""x 6.5"" (approximation). The ""typical"" 9V negative power center is a ""postive"". If you're looking for a way to play with the signal configuration... echoes, vibrators, resurrections, old chords... Not a bad way to start playing with that. You can make a lot of sounds without breaking the bank. Personally, I have other results that make these sounds and do it in a smaller space, so for me... It's not a trick. Your condition may be different from mine. Not a bad product, accepted at its price, just didn't impress me very much.",3
4202,"This pedal is normal. I mean, I provide what it calls basic functionality. It seems a little cheap to say quality. I'm afraid I'll drop a jar when I play. Although the box is metal, it feels like the thinnest metal plate. They can make it. The power switch and Chorus / vibrato switch are obviously the cheapest switches they can find and are not easy to touch their toes. You have to bend over and turn them over. They are small. On the other hand, $69 is a relatively cheap multifunctional pedal. I don't like backward inclined input, output and power plugs. In my opinion, this springboard is not friendly. Good desktop effect. The area of the circuit board is about 7.75 inches × 6.5 inches (about), which is quite large. The power supply of standard 9V center tone is positive. If you're looking for a way to tune - echo, vibrato, mix, old-fashioned chorus. This is a good way to start playing. You won't go bankrupt. You can make a lot of voices. I personally think these sounds have different effects in a small space. So for me. Not a goalkeeper Your situation may be different from mine.

4474,"I bought two sets. Both arrived together on the scheduled delivery date. A few months ago, I bought 102 pailo pmks, including 25 foot 1 / 4 ""The Amazon dealer's cable connection is OK. At first, I only found a slight difference between the two models. The center is the adjustment clip to allow the extension of the middle speaker. Personally, I think it is easier to install Pyle Pro pstk 103. Thereafter, the length of the tripod bridge of the pstk 103 and the length of the shrinking central speaker are higher. However, this kind of packaging seriously weakens the manufacturer's intentions towards my products. There are paint defects on several parts of the leg. There are dents and nicks in several areas of the bridge pavilion. Why is my handling method in the process of transportation not simple, but also condemns the manufacturer's packaging? The tripod support has a plurality of connecting parts extending from the joint. In addition to separating the two devices with a thin plastic bag, the two devices are also placed upside down in a small range of travel bags not added in the transport paper box. In order to prevent the tripod devices from rubbing or colliding with each other during transportation, no protective measures considered in advance are provided. Really, how difficult is it to separate the two units in your travel bag with corrugated paper or expanded foam?!! The good side is. After testing the tripod bracket. Everything seems to be going well. Although these devices are very light, they appear strong and stable once installed. Price is the right idea If the packing method is improved. I would certainly say that so far, this seems to be a great purchase. Only after a period of time and later use can I determine whether this department is established or not, which is a real bargaining.",3

Although useful, more serious players, or those with an aggressive style of playing, might want to spend a little more on a better quality learning belt.

4520,"Most high-quality leather guitar rims are typically $20 or more, so that in retrospect the low cost of this planet Waves Black Leather guitar wheel should have served as a red flag. I bought it anyway, hoping it would be a decent product, but unfortunately, after I received it, I was almost immediately disappointed with the quality of the article. While the belt appears to be 100%-leather and is not a scrap, it does not appear to be of very high quality. The leather is thin and soft, and I wouldn't be surprised if the edges start rolling soon, and the band starts to fold. I don't expect the leather around the holes to hold well for the strap nuts. If you use this belt, you probably want to use some kind of belt buckle. I have leather straps that last over ten years. The leather is thicker and stiffer and has been resistant to abrasion at the edges. While the leather has developed some cracks, it still holds well, and there's no chance that the belt will tear. I could be wrong, but when I look at the planet Waves straps, I doubt that it will stay close or that long. If you are an occasional player, this belt is probably fine, although straps are recommended. The leather begins to roll and deform, but the belt will certainly not fail immediately. While capable, more serious players, or those with an aggressive style of the game, perhaps you would like to spend a little more for a better quality leather straps. I decided to keep this belt, but it's installed on a secondary guitar that I don't play very often.",3

While the belt appears to be 100% leather, and it's not a piece of trash, it doesn't seem to be very high quality. The skin is thin and soft, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if the edges soon start spinning, and the strap starts to wrinkle. I don't expect the skin around the dry fruit holes to last long. If you use this strap, you're gonna have to use some kind of strap-on system. I have leather straps that last over ten years. The skin is thicker and tougher, and resisted wear along the extremities. As the skin has developed some cracks, it's still holding up nicely, and there's no chance of tearing the strap.

It doesn't seem to be garbage, but it doesn't seem to be of high quality. The leather was thin and soft, the edges bent quickly, and the belt began to bend. I wouldn't be surprised at all. I don't want the leather around the belt nut hole to maintain good performance for a long time. If you use this belt, which belt would you like to lock the system with. My belt has been used for more than ten years. The leather is thicker and harder, and the edge is wear-resistant. Although there are some cracks in the leather, it can still support well, and the belt will not tear. I may be wrong, but from the planetary tape, I doubt it can stay well or long anywhere. If you are a casual player, guidance may be good. Although locks are recommended The leather may be bent and deformed, but the belt will certainly not fail immediately.

This not only didn't appear in the red case (I really don't care), but also didn't appear in any version of the case style (I'm interested). The examples cited relate to individual cases at a price of $19 each. So I think WOW! What the hell? I bought seven harmonicas. If I bought them separately, I bought a $19 harmonica set for $6. You're not a stupid bite, are you? -All right They are installed on a cheap, invisible black zipper instead of it with hona's logo. Take your money and order it through your friends.

I didn't fool other functions (metronome? Detuning?), So I can't comment on them. Another comment: I broke a fragile small label fixed to the ball head because the ball head was over stretched.

In short, this is a hybrid package. I will rate the actual tuner's ability as more than 6 stars - this is my favorite ability... Plus the clip itself is absolutely bad production quality. Sigh, it's frustrating to hype a product to your friends... Just follow the mandatory disclaimer. If snark solves this problem, I will immediately restore the rating to the original 5 stars...

I bet a lot of people have experience working with many tuners. Not only that, many tuners even cost more than $20. So I doubt it. But so many high evaluations are certainly not wrong. In terms of price, I think it is a fairly risk-free gamble. I'm glad I tried! The screen is clear and easy to read, and the pitch indicator is stable in one position. I'll never chase the ball again!

So, simply put, this is a mixing bag. I appreciate the actual tuner's ability somewhere on the 6 stars - easily my favorite with this ability. Combine the clip itself with absolutely sad build quality. Sigh. It's like framing your friends about the product. Only follow it with mandatory disclaimer. If you fix the problem of Snark, I will instantly bring back my original 5-star assessment. But until then! Hope you like it. 2.5 stars, up to 3 rounded. Boo. I have a similar tuner in the past. Hope you like it. Almost every tuner I had had not kept reading. And it was a frustrated kid on the way I could not keep. I am willing to bet that many people did this experience with many tuners. Not only that, many of these tuners run above $20 if not more. So I was skeptical. But so many high checks could not be wrong and for the price I found it was quite dangerous gambling. Really glad I try it! The screen is clear and easy to read, the pitch indicator is kept stable in one place. No more chasing the pitch for me!

So, in short, this is a mixed bag. I would have the power of the tuner somewhere over six stars...

4959,"As my comments show, I'm fascinated by a new tuner. Peterson's stroboscopic tuner enjoys a high reputation. I even tried it once, but I don't think it's the kind of thing to take jam. So when I saw Peterson introduce a clip tuner, I couldn't help salivating. ""Clumsiness"" is a relative term, but I don't think it's a harm to use it here. A typical clip on tuner has an LCD ""pointer"". When the pointer is at the dead center, the string is the tuner. If the center is missing, the line is flat. If it goes beyond the center, the rope is sharp. SC-1 has two sets of rings that seem to be rotating, similar to gating. When the ring stops rotating, a string is in the tune. I found it difficult to stop the rotation of the ring in the way of sound attenuation of the string, even in the continuous mode of SC-1. (I have returned the tuner. Otherwise, I just realized that it would be very helpful to make a short film of guitar tuning with SC-1 and zoid or Intelli.) SC-1 also has a ""sweet"" guitar tuning mode. However, when I tuned my recliner guitar this way, I found that the pointer on each string of my Intelli tuner was dead center. (for those who have read my other comments, my favorite zoid is my favorite guitar.) It is likely that others may report that the feature set of SC-1 makes it an ideal choice in other situations. However, if your main purpose is to maintain the tuning of the guitar, SC-1 spends more than three zididzzid z-1000 clips on the color digital tuner of the string instrument through sabinor four intelligent software imt500 clips. It is recommended that you consider zoid or intelligent.",3
4960,"As my comments show, I was attracted by a new tuner. Peterson's stroboscopic tuner is well known. I even tried it once, but I don't think it's the type of jam. So when I saw Peterson show the clip tuner, I couldn't help drooling. ""Clumsy"" is a relative word, but I don't think it's harmful to use it here. A typical clamp tuner has a liquid crystal ""pointer"". When the pointer is in neutral, the string is the tuner. If the centerline is missing, the line is flat. If it goes beyond the center, the rope is sharp. The SC-1 has two sets of rings that look like rotating rings, similar to those of a flash lamp. When the ring stops rotating, a rope is in the tone. I found that even in SC-1 continuous mode, it is difficult to stop the rotation of the ring by weakening the rope sound. (I have returned the tuner to you. Otherwise, I just realized that it would be helpful to make a short film about guitar chords with SC-1 and zoid or Intelli.) The SC-1 also has a ""soft"" guitar setting mode. However, when I adjusted my bench guitar in this way, I found that the pointer on each string of my Intelli tuner was a blind spot. (for those who have read my other comments, my favorite zoid is my favorite guitar.) others may say that the feature set of SC-1 makes it an ideal choice for other situations. However, if your main goal is to maintain the tone of the guitar, because the cost of SC-1 exceeds three zoidszoid z-1000, a digital color string tuner produced by Sabine or intellisitelli imt500, I suggest you consider using zoid or Intelli.",3
4961,"As my review shows, I'm suckers for a new tuner. Peterson has excellent reputation for strobe tuners. I tried once, but it decided not to carry around to jam. So I couldn't help saliva when Peterson saw a clip introduced to the tuner. ""Annoying"" is a relative term, but using it here does not feel it unpleasant. The typical clip of the tuner has a liquid crystal ""needle"". The string is a tuner when the needle is dead. If it is short of the string the string is flat. The string is sharp if it is the center of the past. SC-1 has two sets of rings that seem to rotate. When the ring rotates, the string is in tune. I found it difficult to get the ring in the way that the sound of a string collapses. (it was a great help to make a short video to tune the guitar using SC-1 and zoid and intelli). SC-1 also boasts a ""spoiled"" mode for tuning guitars. But when I played this way in the guitar of the house, I found that the needle was dead in all strings of my intelligence tuner. (for those who read my other reviews, my favorite zoid was my favorite guitar) It may well be, and others may report that the SC-1 feature set makes it ideal for other situations. But if you are to keep the guitar in the song for the main purpose, then It is recommended that you consider zoid or Intelli by SC3 splitting over three or more zoidszoid z-1000 on a chromatic digital tuner for strings by tuner or four intellisintelli imt500 clips with tuner.",3
4962,"As my comments show, I am fascinated by the new regulator. Peterson frequency modulator is well known. I even tried it once, but I don't think it's about jam. So when I saw Peterson introducing this video, I couldn't help swallowing. ""Clumsiness"" is a relative term, but I don't think it's a harm to use it here. A typical clamp adjuster has an LCD ""pointer"". When the arrow is at the dead center, the string is the regulator If there is no center, the lines are aligned. If it is above the center, the rope will be very sharp. SC-1 consists of two groups that seem to rotate in a ring similar to the selected channel. When the ring stops rotating, the string becomes the tone I found it difficult to stop the ring even in the continuous mode of SC-1. Otherwise, I just realized that it would be helpful to make a short film with SC-1, zoid or Intelli guitar tones. SC-1 also has a ""sweet"" guitar tune. However, when I adjusted the recliner guitar like this, I found that all the pointers on each string of my smart resonator were dead. (for those who have read my comments, my favorite zoid is my favorite guitar.) It is likely that others may report that the SC-1 feature set makes it ideal for other situations. However, if your main goal is to maintain the tone of the guitar, since the cost of SC-1 exceeds three zoidszoid z-1000, it is produced for strings by Sabine or four intellisintelli imt500, I suggest you consider using zoid or Intelli.",3

When I saw Peterson put a clip on the tuner, all I could do was drool. Difficult is a relative concept, but I don't think it's a bad service to use it here. The typical clip-on tuner has an LCD ""needle"". When the needle is in the middle, the string is tuner. If it's not in the middle, the string is flat. When it's past the middle, the string is sharp. The SC-1 has two sets of rings that seem to rotate, analogous to what a noose might look like. A string is in harmony when the rings stop spinning. I found that with the way the sound of strings fades, it's hard to stop the rings from spinning, even in the SC-1 mode. (I have already returned the tuner.

In my opinion, I should test it as a microphone and USB IO device. The first appearance was impressive. There is a well separated suitcase. Inside is a milled aluminum table stand, a cable, a short manual and a microphone. Impact free installation. The microphone looks good, but it has little quality. Although this may not mean anything, I have owned and used many microphones - none of them lack weight like this. I arranged a gun fight in my studio. I have an acoustically treated room with calibrated studio monitors, so I think I can do a fair test. I use a steel string guitar to play in many styles to keep it simple. As a comparison microphone, I used AKG perception 420. This is a multi-mode microphone, only a little more expensive; The price of heart disease only version is exactly the same as this MXL. I only used the heart model, so I think it is based on a fair price comparison. Speaking of ideas, AKG beat MXL in all aspects. It's quieter and has a better midrange effect. Just look at the specification (MXL online) and you will find that there is a significant increase in higher frequencies, resulting in a frequency increase of about 3K by about 3dB. Polarity mode is displayed only in broadband (not at multiple frequencies) and tilt is displayed at 45 degrees. These are easy for me to hear. Therefore, as only one microphone, MXL cannot compete with other microphones in its price range. But this is not a complete comparison. The MXL has a small headphone jack on the side so that performers can listen with zero delay. This is a plus sign, but it also has several major disadvantages. The microphone is easily affected by cable scratch and earphone cable vibration. It is best to ensure that it remains stationary during use. There is also a volume knob, which seems to affect the listening and recording level. This means that it is easy to inadvertently distort the recording volume when installing a microphone or adjusting the listening volume. There is also an optional software control panel (MAC and windows) that comes with the microphone. It provides a noise gate and compressor, as well as some basic control devices for recording and monitoring. I'm unlikely to use this dynamic processing; Once completed, it cannot be undone. When I have enough time to make a call, I will apply these afterwards. This leaves level control -- MXL could have been more careful here. The microphone gain is used in conjunction with the thumb wheel of the microphone itself. What needs to be done to find out who did what. There is a high pass filter - very useful when rumbling is a problem. But we don't know whether the filter is in analog domain or digital domain. I hope it is simulated, but there is nothing about it in the document. Then there is the biggest problem. There is a playback level control that allows your mix to be played through the headset jack of the microphone. But it also means - depending on your Daw - that it's easy to establish a feedback path. You won't like it. The biggest question in my mind is ""who is this microphone for?""? Traditional microphones can be connected to any preamplifier and used at any sampling rate. I have a microphone (both expensive and cheap) and I have used it for many years. Only the preamplifier / interface changes. This MXL is USB only, 44 / 48 only. If there is no clock problem, you cannot easily set up multiple USB microphones. Most USB / FireWire microphone preamplifiers have zero delay monitoring mode, so the microphone will not provide any functions that cannot be provided elsewhere. Finally, I really don't think it's a good choice, except for the most casual musicians. For me, the ground aluminum desktop stand is the answer. If you are a podcast or a serious SKYPER, this microphone is worth considering.

It seemed like I needed to test both as a USB IO device as a microphone. Very first appearance is impressive. There is a well conditioned carrying case. Inside is aluminum stand, cable, short manual and microphone. No shock mount. Mike looks good, but there is little trout. This may not be meaningful, but I own and have used many microphones - none of them are lacking in trouble. I started a shooting battle in the studio. I have an acoustically treated room at the calibration studio monitor. I used steel guitar played in some styles, and it continued to be easy. The comparison microphone used AKG perception 420. This is just an expensive multi pattern mic, cardio only version is the same price as this MXL. I think that it is just a fair comparison based on price because I used only cardidish pattern. AKG hit MXL in every way to get points. It was more quiet in a better midrange. A glance at spec, online of MXL, shows significant boost at higher frequencies. And it leads to an increase of about 3 dB in 8K or so. The polarity pattern is shown only in broadband (not multiple frequencies), which shows the dip at a 45 degree position. These were things I could easily hear. So MXL is not comparable to other microphones in its price range as purely Mike. But it's not a perfect comparison. MXL has a small headphone jack on the side so that the player can listen in zero latency. It comes with a large abuse couple plus. The microphone is weak to cable scoop and vibration coming down the headphone cable -- better make sure you still stay when you use it. There is also a volume knob that affects listening and recording levels. This means you are accidentally distorting the recording level when you are mounting the microphone accidentally or adjusting the listening level. Also optional software control panel (MAC and windows) goes with the microphone. It provides noise gates and compressors as some basic controls for recording and monitoring. I never use this dynamics process once, but it can't be done. I apply them after the fact that I have enough time to dial them. This level control - leave the location where MXL was more careful. Mike has a microphone gain that works in conjunction with the SAM wheel. Do something to understand what to do. Welcome to the high pass filter - the scramble problem is tremendous. But we don't know if this filter is in an analog or digital domain. I want it to be analog, but there is nothing about it in the documentation. Then there's the biggest problem. Mike's headphone jack has a playback level control that allows you to play through the mix. But this also follows your Daw -- setting up a feedback path is easy. You don't like it. The biggest problem in my mind is, ""just who is this Mike?"" Conventional microphones can be connected to any preamplifier and can be used with any sample rate. I've got Mike (expensive and cheap) that brought me years and years. Preamp / interface changes only. This MXL is USB only, 44 / 48 only. You can't easily set the multiple of USB microphones without clocking the issue. Most USB / FireWire mic preps have zero latency monitoring modes, so Mike does not really provide anything you can't get elsewhere. After all, I don't really think this is a good choice for musicians' casual stuff. For me that polished aluminum desk mount has an answer. This microphone deserves consideration if you are a podcast or serious SKYPER. It is a decent microphone for spoken voice - HF boost is useful in articulating - and one USB connection keeps your desk unattended. Of course, there are many other choices of that application.

Inside there is a ground aluminium desk, a cable, a short manual and the microphone. No shock absorber. The microphone looks good, but it has almost no mass. Although this may not mean much, I own and have used many microphones, none of them have this lack of power. I've arranged a shooting at my studio. I have an acoustically treated room with calibrated studio monitors, so I think I can do an honest test. I kept it simple, using a steel string guitar played in different styles. For a comparison, I used an AKG Perception 420. This is a multimodel microphone that is just a little more expensive; a cardiod-only version is exactly the same price as this MXL. I only used the cardio pattern, so I think it's a fair comparison based on the price. To get to the point, the AKG beat the MXL in every way. It was quieter, with a much better range. A glance at the specs (online at MXL) shows a significant boost in higher frequencies, leading to about a 3dB increase at 8K or something. The polar pattern is only shown in broadband (not multiple frequencies) and shows a dip on the 45-degree position. These were things I could easily hear. So purely as a microphone, the MXL does not match other microphones in its price range. But that's not a complete comparison. The MXL has a small headphone jacket on the side so the performer can listen with zero latency. That's a plus with a few big Minnies. The microphone is vulnerable to wires and vibrations coming through the headphone. Make sure you stay still when you use it. There is also a volume button that affects both listening and recording levels. This means that it is easy to accidentally affect the recording level when installing the microphone or adjusting your listening level. There is also an optional software control panel (Mac and Windows) that matches the microphone. It provides a sound port and compressor as long as there are a number of basic controls for recording and monitoring. I'll never use this dynamic. Once it's done, it can't be undone. I'd use it after the fact if I had enough time to call them. This leaves the level control, a place where MXL could have been more careful. There is a microphone that works in combination with the thumb ring on the microphone itself. It'll take some time to figure out what's doing. There's a high-pass filter... enormously useful if messing around is a problem. But we don't know if this filter is in the analog or digital domain. I hope it's analogue, but there's nothing left in the documentation. Then there's the biggest problem. There is a play back-level control that allows your mix to play back via the microphone's main phone. But this also means that depending on your DAW, it is easy to set up a feedback path. You're not gonna like that. The biggest question in my head is, ""Who's this microphone for?"" A traditional mic can be connected to any preemp and used at any sample speed. I have microphones (both expensive and cheap) that I have for years. Only the preamp/interface changes. This MXL is only USB, 44/48. You cannot easily set up multiple USB microphones without clocks. Most USB/FIREIR microphones have a zero-latency monitoring mode, so the microphone doesn't really offer anything you can't find anywhere else. In the end, I don't really think this is a good choice for one of the most random musicians. For me, that white aluminum desk has the answer. If you're a podcaster or a serious Skyper, this microphone deserves attention. It's a decent microphone for a spoken voice, the HF boost helps to generate articulation... And the single USB connection doesn't keep your desk complicated. Of course, there are plenty of other options for that application. But I think that's the best light for this one.",3

So, purely as a microphone, the MXL does not match other microphones in its price range. But that's not a complete comparison. The MXL has a small headset on the side so that the performer can listen without latency. That's a plus that comes with a few big minus points. The microphone is susceptible to cable aspirations and vibrations coming down through the headset. You better make sure you keep quiet when using it. There is also a volume controller that affects both hearing and recording. This means that it is easy to unintentionally distort the recording values when you install the microphone or change your hearing level. There is also an optional software control (Mac and Windows) that goes with the microphone. It provides a noise gate and compressor as long as some basic controls for recording and monitoring are available. It's unlikely I'll ever process that dynamic. Once done, it cannot be undone. I would use them if I had enough time to intervene. This leaves the level control behind, a place where MXL could have been more careful. There is a microphone recording that works in conjunction with the thumb wheel on the microphone itself. You have to do something to find out who's doing what. There is a high-pass filter that is very useful if grudges are a problem. But we do not know if this filter is t in the analogue or digital domain. I hope it is analogue, but there is nothing about it in the documentation. Then there's the biggest problem.

You're not gonna like this. The biggest question in my head is, who is this microphone for? A traditional microphone can be connected to any pre-amplifier and used in any sample rate. I have microphones (expensive and cheap) that I have had for years. Only the pre-amplifier/interface changes. This MXL is only USB, 44/48. You cannot simply set up multiple USB microphones without detecting problems. Most USB/FIrewire microphone pre-amplifiers have a zero latency monitoring mode, so the microphone doesn't really offer something you can't get anywhere else. In the end, I don't really think that this is a good choice for everyone except for the laziest musicians. For me, the hardened aluminum table equipment is the answer.

4989,"This is an interesting idea for a microphone: a nice compactor with integrated monitoring. A possible simple solution for the musician who wants to keep the stage to a minimum. It seemed to me that I should try it both as a microphone and as a USB IO device. The first appearance is impressive. There's a nice suitcase. Inside, there's a glass booth, a cable, a short manual and a microphone. There will be no electroshock. The microphone looks good, but it doesn't have any mass. Although that may not mean much, I own it, and I've used a lot of microphones... None of them are that bad. I arranged a shootout at my studio. I have a room with set monitors, so I think I can do a fair test. I kept it simple, using a steel guitar played in different styles. For a microphone comparison, I used AKG Perception 420. This is a multiple microphone that's a little more expensive. a cardiovascular version is exactly the same value as this MXL. I only used the cardiological pattern, so I think it's a fair comparison based on the price. To get to the point, AKG beat MXL in every way. It was quieter, with a much better medium. A look at the specs (online in MXL) shows a significant increase in higher frequencies, leading to about 3dB increase in 8K or something. The Polish standard appears only on a broadband connection (not multiple frequencies) and shows a drop in position 45degree. Those were things I could easily hear. So, purely as a microphone, the MXL doesn't match any other microphones at its value. But that's not a complete comparison. The MXL has a small headset on the side so that the performer can hear with zero latency. That's a plus that comes with two big minuses. The microphone is vulnerable to scratches of wires and vibrations coming off the headset. You better make sure you're still when you use it. There is also a sound button that seems to affect the sound and recording level. This means it's easy to inadvertently distort the recording levels when you turn on the microphone or adjust your listening level. There is also an optional software control panel (Mac and Windows) that matches the microphone. Provides a door and a noise compressor, if certain basic controls for recording and monitoring. It's impossible to use this dynamic processing. When it's done, it can't be undone. I'd wear them after the event, when I have enough time to call them. That leaves the control levels... a place where MXL could be more careful. There's a microphone that works in conjunction with the wheel in the microphone. You need to do something to understand what he's doing. There's a high-speed filter, extremely useful when noise is a problem. But we don't know if this filter is in the analog or digital field. I hope it's proportional, but there's nothing about it in the file. There's the biggest problem. There's a playback level control that allows your mix to play back through the microphone's audio button. But this also means that depending on your DAW, it is easy to set a feedback path. You're not gonna like this. The biggest question on my mind is, ""Who's this microphone for?"" A traditional microphone can be connected to any preamble and used at any sample rate. I have microphones (both expensive and cheap) that I've had for years. Only the prefix/interface changes. This MXL is only USB, 44/48 only. You can't easily create multiple USB microphones without shutting down problems. Most USB/FIREwire microphones have zero latent monitoring function, so the microphone doesn't really offer anything you can't get anywhere else. In the end, I don't think it's a good choice for anyone, but for the simplest musicians. For me, this aluminum glass cap has the answer. If you're an announcer or a serious Skyper, then this microphone deserves attention.

4990,"This is an interesting microphone idea. The built-in monitor is a good capacitor. In my opinion, musicians really want to minimize the drill bit. I have to test it with a microphone and USB IO device. The first blind date is impressive. There is a good suitcase. There are aluminum tables, cables, simple manuals and microphones. Impact free installation. The microphone looks good, but it has little quality. I don't know what that means. I've used a lot of microphones. No one is so short of weight. I arranged a gun fight in my studio. I have a sanctified room with a calibrated studio monitor. I think I can conduct a fair test. I played Qiangxian guitar in various styles to keep it simple. The comparison microphone is AKG perception 420 This is a multi-mode microphone. It's a little expensive. Only the heart disease version and MXL have the same price. I think this is the basis of a fair price comparison, because I only use the heart model. Speaking of ideas, AKG beat MXL in every way. It's quieter and has a better midrange effect. From the perspective of the specification (MXL online), it is significantly improved at higher frequencies, and the frequency of about 8K is increased by about 3dB. Polarity mode is displayed only on broadband, not multiple frequencies, and shows a 45 degree tilt. These are easy for me to hear. Therefore, one MXL microphone cannot compare with another. But this is not a complete comparison. There is a small earphone plug on the side of the MXL, which can be heard by actors with zero delay. This is positive, but it also has several major disadvantages. The microphone is easily affected by cable scratch and earphone cable vibration. It is best to ensure that it is stopped when using. There is also a volume switch that may affect listening and recording levels. In other words, it is easy to inadvertently distort the recording volume when installing a microphone or adjusting the listening volume. There is also a software control board that can be selected with the microphone. It provides noise doors and compressors, as well as basic controls for recording and monitoring. I can't use this dynamic processing. Once completed, it cannot be cancelled. When I have enough time to call, I will apply these afterwards. Now there is hierarchy control left. MXL is more careful here. The gain of the microphone is used with the gear of the microphone itself. Know who did what and what to do There is a very useful pain filter when banging becomes a problem. But we don't know whether the filter is in the analog field or in the digital field. I hope it is simulated, but there is nothing about it in the file. The second is the biggest problem. In order to let mix play through the headphone jack of the microphone, there is a playback level control. But that means it's easier to build a feedback path based on your Daw. I won't like it. The biggest question in my mind is ""who is this microphone for?"" Traditional microphones can be connected to all bulb amplifiers for use as sampling rates. I have a microphone. I've been writing for years. Only change the bulb amplifier / interface. This MXL is dedicated to USB and 44 / 48. If there is no clock problem, you can't easily set up multiple USB microphones. Most USB / FireWire microphone bulb amplifiers have zero delay monitoring mode, so the microphone does not provide any functions that cannot be provided elsewhere. Finally, except for the most free musicians, I don't think it's a good choice. For me, the bracket of the broken aluminum table is the answer. If you are an announcer or a serious air man, this microphone is worth considering. This is a good microphone. High frequency enhancement helps improve clarity. A single USB connection keeps your desk clean. Of course, there are many other options for this program. I think this is the best light.",3

A new battery can be installed without releasing it from the headstock. Disadvantages: - it is inconvenient to use when it is not used on the inline six tuning pin spindle box. I have a Gibson Les Paul and this tuner is embarrassed to use it- There are fewer gradients in the settings than other tuners. The gradient strips are getting thicker and fewer, so people can't feel how close they are to perfect tuning. Controversial: - clamping mechanism: not spring loaded. This means that the device is designed to keep the perfect combination with your guitar. One battery: this device only needs one battery and the other only needs two batteries. In the final analysis, I prefer my old planetary wave tuner. In my opinion, finer grading is more accurate (although the two units give roughly the same results when tuning - using two units at the same time), and I like to clip them up and down quickly. In fact, I can easily recommend the tuner. The main disadvantage is that one person eats the battery).

The power and frequency buttons are only feathers really; I prefer them with more Top surface are a and a little click to them. The tuner can be calibrated in full steps from 430 to 450 if 440 esn't work for you. One advantage of a chromatic tuner is you can tune to a chord and are not limited to (normally) diatonic open strings. For me, I only use tuner to set the pitch of a string, usually the low A for guitar or bass and low G for mandolin. In my opinion, it is only slightly better to tune a freestanding instrument entirely through open strings than to tune it completely with harmonies, and also the Job not good. Intonation is subject to a bunch of variables: string action and thickness, neck strap, ferret state, mother and bridge state. As soon as I have a single string for the pitch, I fit to ferrets and open string unisons and octaves. After a while you will learn which combination for each instrument works best I'm not quite sure how we vote about'We vote because we worry'I'm so ashamed to stand here and vote, I hope nobody notices', but the NS Mini Headstock Tuner --questionable design choice and everything - does what he tells m e to at a minimum effort.",3

Accidents appear as sharp or alternating levels using the alternative functions of the frequency key. The coordinator's viewing window is slightly larger than a Chiclet, but the brightness and analysis are fine for dimly lit spaces. One thing that's less than ideal is the coal color of the coordinator himself. If you've ever thrown things into dark places, you know what I mean. I bet the back of the heads is lighter than the darker, so if the discretion is what the manufacturer's stressing, A lighter color can work better. The notes look red when they're out of tune. Their color changes to green as a ""rough marker"". Then continue to adjust using the vertical bars shown on both sides of the note. They've done everything to make the coordinator scene-friendly, but I'd prefer green to mean ""well-rounded and ready."" So I can look away. I should only deal with bars if I'm struggling to get home.

The advantage of a color coordinator is that is to be coordinated in a chorus and is not limited to (usually) For myself, I only use coordinates to adjust the pitch of a string, usually the low A for guitar or bass and the low G for mandolin. No, the adjustment of a clamped instrument with open strings is slightly better than fully winding it with harmonics, and the work is not good either. variables: action of strings and thickness, neck relief, tightness, dry state and bridge. As soon as I have a string to fly, I fit with the tightened and open strings and the After a while you learn which combination works best for each organ. I'm not quite sure how we've progressed from ""coordinating because we care"" to ""I'm so ashamed to stand here and hope no one understands this,"" but the Mini Headstock coordinator (NS Mini Headstock) is a dubious design and does what he says with the slightest fuss.",3

If you've ever thrown something on a dark stage, you know what I mean. The back of most suitcases is not dark, but light. If manufacturers emphasize caution, light color will be better. The notes are red when they go off. Their color turned green and rough signs. Then use the vertical film marked on both sides of the note to continue fine-tuning. They have done their best to make the adjustment stage friendly, but I prefer green, which means ""fine tuning is completed"". So I can see it in the distance. If I struggle at home, I will only be sad for the bar (according to my experience, this is an exception, not a rule. It is usually caused by the following reasons: new line, loosening of bridge head pin, sliding of adjuster, etc. If a large number of changed lines are not used, the middle-aged line will stretch and untie under predictable conditions. The design of NS is the main melody of the instrument From your point of view, back. I'm left-handed. Unlike other adjusters, I like to rotate the support. You can look up from the right.

At the beginning, it was a saw fixed in the trunk. I don't like your pliers. I can hold the pliers tightly with one hand and fix the regulator, but I think it can only be taken down with two hands. One hand pressed the release device and the other took out the pliers. After a while, I found that this was not the case through practice. I see. The touch is not difficult at all. The mediator is made of painstaking composite materials such as parachute clips seen in the bag. Although it has not been stepped on, it can not only be used for a long time, but also can not be disconnected. I am impressed that the battery is removed from the separate package. Small envelope. There is a slot that can be easily opened with a pick or coin. The regulator has the function of automatic shutdown to maintain the life of the battery. The power and frequency buttons are actually just a nib. I want them to be larger, surface and a little click. If 440 In this way, the adjuster can be adjusted in an integer between 430 and 450. ESN is not suitable for you. One of the advantages of halftone adjuster is that it can adjust the code (general) It's not limited to the whole tone open county. The whole tone open county. I only set up one line pitch tuner. It's usually the low a of guitar or bass and the low g of Tallinn. In my opinion, it's better to use the whole open county to adjust annoying instruments than to use and tone. Both of them are better. Various adjustment methods are not good. The intonation is affected by a series of factors. Variables: string action and thickness, wood tone, friction state, nut and joint state. If I raise a string instrument, the short tone and octave of friction and open string are consistent. After a period of time, I will know which combination is most suitable for all instruments I looked at the pig nose sized ""strob-a-tunners"" placed in the amplifier, but I didn't know how we ""tuned because of our concern"" to ""it's so shy to stand here tuning.

5552,"After I lost my plan and wave s, I tried to do it. I don't know whether I got lost at the concert or my three-year-old son took it with me. I bet it's the last time. This micro regulator is smaller than you and not too noisy, which is good. This is the only professional player. I think there are other possibilities, such as the possibility of choosing tools, but I don't need it. Disadvantages: the reading is small, uh, but not so vivid. I often get married in the sunny air. This scene is more dangerous to you than ever before. This micro regulator does not seem to be as responsive as a micro regulator When you are close to the same source, these articles will not move smoothly to the center, so it is easy to recreate or adjust, And it may take a few more seconds to complete the work than Mini. These seconds count when the bride waits for you to put her song in the corridor and you try to make your tone absolutely perfect. I also try to keep my voice down and adjust my semitone guitar as much as possible, so ear tuning is not a feasible choice. Can this accomplish the task? Yeah. However, the size of a product is almost the same, but it is more efficient, and the price difference may be small. It may even be cheaper. If you are a novice and want to choose your customized tool, you can have an extra few seconds, or you can play in a dark environment without super bright readings, This would be nice, but I use mini when buying new tools.",3
5553,"I tried this after I lost my planet waves and designed a mini tuner. I'm not sure if I lost it in a performance, or if my three-year-old son got his hands on it, I bet on the last one. This micro tuner is smaller and less conspicuous than the mini, which is fun. That's about the only pro. There are a few other features, such as being able to select the tool used, but I do not need that. Cons: The reading is smaller, duh, but does not seem to be so clear. I play a lot of weddings out in the open, in the bright sun, and this one's a lot harder to read than the mini. This micro tuner doesn't seem to fit as well as the mini. If you are closer to In-tune, the bars do not move smoothly to the center, so it is easy to transfer or under tune, and may take a few seconds longer than the mini to get the job done. And those seconds can count when a bride is waiting for you to play her song to walk down the aisle and you're trying to get your tuning absolutely perfect. I'm also trying to tune my semi-acoustic guitar as quietly as possible, so using my ear for fine tuning is not an option. Did it do the job? Good. But there is a product of almost the same size that works a little better, for a negligible price difference. It might even be cheaper. If you're a beginner and you want to choose the instrument that you want to vote and a few extra seconds is not a problem, or you're playing in dark environments and you don't need a super clear reading, this will be good, but I'll go with the mini if I buy a new one.",3

There are a few other features, such as the ability to select the instrument used, but I do not need that. Cons: The display is smaller but does not seem to be so bright. I play many outdoor weddings in bright sun, and this one is much harder to read than the mini. This microdrone doesn't seem to be as sensitive as the mini.

I think I can choose other functions, such as musical instruments, but I don't need them. Disadvantages: the number of reads is small, well, but it doesn't seem so bright. I often hold my wedding in the sunny field. This wedding is more ugly than a small theater. This spinner does not seem as responsive as the mini model. When approaching tuning, these ropes will not translate to the center, so it is easy to be excessive or uncoordinated, which takes a few seconds more than the mini. When the bride is waiting for your song to go up the channel, when you try to make the tune absolutely perfect, you can calculate it in a few seconds. I also try to adjust my semicircular guitar quietly, so fine tuning with my ears is not a feasible option. Can you finish the task? Yeah. However, the size of a product is almost the same, but the effect is better, and the price difference can not be ignored. It may even be cheaper. If you are a beginner, choose a coordinated instrument. You don't need extra time or play in a dark environment.

5561,"I'm straight forward and honest, and I say I'm not the biggest fan of head stock tuner. I love the idea, but usually I feel left leaving a bit of hope to run. But when this appeared on my vine newsletter I thought I would see if it went and that I fixed something in what I didn't like about other things such as cough * snark * cough *. I think there is a little background at first. I have played guitar for the past nine years. I can use the microphone in front to adjust just how it can pick up your signal with the instrument cable and have a little Korg plugin type. I also have a boss TU-3 pedal tuner. If I'm stuck with a friend or do a show, ti-3 is what I use to stay in tune. Its very durable and accurate, I can adjust in silence so I can steer it to engage the tuner and cut my guitar signal, and don't bother my friends and / or spectators. I usually try to connect to my practice amp and blast off the blast, so I usually tune up as a tune up for home practice. The Korg is simple enough, accurate and easy enough for alternate tuning, and in nine years that has it (I've only purchased one jam jam before buying ti-3). When the friend went to get an electronic tuner, I first saw the headstock tuner, and the person in the guitar shop told him that blue cry he seems to have these days. He could not believe. It was not only somewhat flashy to have a big blue ball sitting on your headstock, it seemed to me a little thin and it wasn't exatly easy to tune it. I thought the idea of having a tuner that worked off your guitar resonances was cool, but it seemed like the design had made a little way before I wanted to be in my headstock. Enter this mini headstock tuner with planet waves. Does it fix the problem that made snark to complain to my friends and me? Accuracy: it seems to adjust exactly, it is good, and it already puts this before the nark. But keep in mind that it is not so easy to use tuning instead. It also comes to some use to make use of a witty LCD block style like characters found in some DVD players. It's not a big complaint, but it's not a stupid proof as my Korg or tu-3.2. Looks / usability: it is pretty much more subtle than the snakes that can hide behind your headstock that is desirable to have a blue ball sitting at the edge of your guitar. The only problem you are hiding behind your headstock is that if you have a paddle style headstock that you have three tuners on each side, the tuner actually fits There may be a struggle to find a place that can be seen. My LP copy has a bigger Glover tuner. I could find the area where I could see it from the top because I did the guitar very low, but the person who grinds it might be a higher luck. Those with fender style headstock should have no problem but it works great for them. Moreover, because it is bright and bright, it does not become a problem even if it sees enough. Durability: This is where there are major drawbacks to these types of tuners. Snack is very easy to break because it's on the small ball joint. This planet wave Mini is not going to lose its head too easily, but the ratchet clip is made of plastic and I don't expect it to hold under too much use. As the tuner itself is made of pretty light duty plastic, so it's great to be able to keep this in your pocket on the road to the jam session, I still think it's easy to break enough. I still can't give you my first impression because this doesn't have enough length to happen. Let's just say this I won't be gig this guy as my sole tuner. Its obviously not rugged enough for use of that type. All in all, it is a better headstock choice than snark. But as the whole headstock tuner there is still a way to go before they're going to work for everyone. Jig will often be better to get some kind of pedal tuner (I personally suggest boss Tu-2 or TU-3 or Korg pitchblack). I know they are more expensive but you are happier in the long run. Looking for a convenient way to tune between songs during these jam sessions, this is a great option. But it may not hold forever.

This is a good choice for those who are looking for a convenient way to tune between songs during the Kam conference. But it may not last forever. I may stick to my TU-3 and my Korg plug-in, but with the development of the headset tuner, this is better than most.",3
5563,"I want to tell you the truth now. I'm not the biggest fan of headframe tuner. I like the idea, but usually I feel a little dissatisfied. But when this appeared in my vine newsletter, I thought I should see if this book can solve the problems I don't like in other books. I want to start with the context. I've been playing the guitar for the past nine years, and now I have two tuners. I have a small Korg plug-in that you can get your signal through the instrument cable or just use the microphone set in front. I also have a pedal tuner boss TU-3. If I chat or perform with my friends, I will use TU-3 to keep the rhythm. This is very durable and accurate. I like how I handle it, tune and cut off my guitar signal at the same time, so that I can adjust it quietly without disturbing my friends and / or audience. For home practice, I use Korg because I usually make adjustments before I start playing, then plug in my practice amplifier and start it. Korg is a good and accurate, easy-to-use alternative protocol. After 9 years of use (including TU-3 before and after purchasing jam), I only need to buy one alternative. A year ago, when a friend of mine went to buy an electronic tuner, I saw a head tuner for the first time. The man in the guitar store convinced him to fall into the depression everyone has now. He is not very satisfied with this. It's not just a fantasy. You have a big blue ball on your head. It looks a little fragile. It's not easy for me to adjust it with it. Although I think the idea of having a tuner working on your guitar is cool, it seems to be a design that still has a way to go before I want it. Planetary waves enter this miniature head tuner. Can it solve the problems that my friends and I don't like? 1. Accuracy: it seems that the adjustment is very accurate, which is a good thing and has been ahead of snark. However, choosing chords is not easy, so remember this. In addition, these letters take some time to adapt because they use the bulky LCD screens of some DVD players. It's not a big complaint, but it's not evidence of stupidity like my Korg or tu-3.2. Appearance / ease of use: it's much more subtle than snark and can be hidden behind your brooch box, which is much better than putting a blue ball at the end of the guitar. The only problem is that if you have a Les Paul style head box with three tuners on each side, it may be difficult to find a really suitable and visible tuner. My LP copy has a larger Grover tuner, so my only choice is at the end of the spindle box. I put my guitar low, so I found a place to see it from top to bottom, but those who play a little higher may be unlucky. These fender truck heads should be OK, although it's good for them. Moreover, it's very bright, so it's no problem to see clearly enough. 3. Durability: This is the main disadvantage of these tuners. The snake hook breaks easily because it is placed on a small ball knot. This mini planetary wave is not easy to lose its mind, but the ratchet is plastic. I don't want to leave it in place to prevent overuse. The tuner itself is also made of fairly light plastic, so it would be good to put it in your pocket on the way to the jam meeting, but I still think it's easy to break. I don't have enough time for it to happen, so I can only give you my first impression. I've never seen this guy. He's my only tuner. Obviously, it is not strong enough for this purpose. In short, it is a better choice of headstock than bisnac. However, the spindle box tuner as a whole still has a long way to go before working for everyone. For all people who often play, it is best to use the pedal tuner (I personally recommend using boss Tu-2, TU-3 or Korg pitchblack). I know they are more expensive, but in the long run, you will be happier. This is a good choice for those looking for a convenient way to adjust the cam meeting between songs. But this may not last forever. I may stick with my TU-3 and Korg plug-ins, but with the development of the header frame tuner, it is better than most.",3
5564,"I'm straight forward and honest, and I say I'm not the biggest fan of head stock tuner. I love the idea, but usually I feel left leaving a bit of hope to run. But when this appeared on my vine newsletter I thought I would see if it went and that I fixed something in what I didn't like about other things such as cough * snark * cough *. I think there is a little background at first. I have played guitar for the past nine years. I can use the microphone in front to adjust just how it can pick up your signal with the instrument cable and have a little Korg plugin type. I also have a boss TU-3 pedal tuner. If I'm stuck with a friend or do a show, ti-3 is what I use to stay in tune. Its very durable and accurate, I can adjust in silence so I can steer it to engage the tuner and cut my guitar signal, and don't bother my friends and / or spectators. I usually try to connect to my practice amp and blast off the blast, so I usually tune up as a tune up for home practice. The Korg is simple enough, accurate and easy enough for alternate tuning, and in nine years that has it (I've only purchased one jam jam before buying ti-3). When the friend went to get an electronic tuner, I first saw the headstock tuner, and the person in the guitar shop told him that blue cry he seems to have these days. He could not believe. It was not only somewhat flashy to have a big blue ball sitting on your headstock, it seemed to me a little thin and it wasn't exatly easy to tune it. I thought the idea of having a tuner that worked off your guitar resonances was cool, but it seemed like the design had made a little way before I wanted to be in my headstock. Enter this mini headstock tuner with planet waves. Does it fix the problem that made snark to complain to my friends and me? Accuracy: it seems to adjust exactly, it is good, and it already puts this before the nark. But keep in mind that it is not so easy to use tuning instead. It also comes to some use to make use of a witty LCD block style like characters found in some DVD players. It's not a big complaint, but it's not a stupid proof as my Korg or tu-3.2. Looks / usability: it is pretty much more subtle than the snakes that can hide behind your headstock that is desirable to have a blue ball sitting at the edge of your guitar. The only problem you are hiding behind your headstock is that if you have a paddle style headstock that you have three tuners on each side, the tuner actually fits There may be a struggle to find a place that can be seen. My LP copy has a bigger Glover tuner. I could find the area where I could see it from the top because I did the guitar very low, but the person who grinds it might be a higher luck. Those with fender style headstock should have no problem but it works great for them. Moreover, because it is bright and bright, it does not become a problem even if it sees enough. Durability: This is where there are major drawbacks to these types of tuners. Snack is very easy to break because it's on the small ball joint. This planet wave Mini is not going to lose its head too easily, but the ratchet clip is made of plastic and I don't expect it to hold under too much use. As the tuner itself is made of pretty light duty plastic, so it's great to be able to keep this in your pocket on the road to the jam session, I still think it's easy to break enough. I still can't give you my first impression because this doesn't have enough length to happen. Let's just say this I won't be gig this guy as my sole tuner. Its obviously not rugged enough for use of that type. All in all, it is a better headstock choice than snark. But as the whole headstock tuner there is still a way to go before they're going to work for everyone. Jig will often be better to get some kind of pedal tuner (I personally suggest boss Tu-2 or TU-3 or Korg pitchblack). I know they are more expensive but you are happier in the long run. Looking for a convenient way to tune between songs during these jam sessions, this is a great option. But it may not hold forever. I would probably stick to my TU-3 and my Korg plug-ins, but this is almost as clean as the headstock tuner goes.",3
5565,"I will immediately say frankly and honestly that I am not the biggest fan in the headlines. I like the idea, but usually I feel that the implementation is somewhat unsatisfactory. But when it appeared in my report on the events in Vienna, I thought I should try to see if this book worked with other books I didn't like (coughing) . I'd like to talk about the background first. I've been playing the guitar for the past 9 years, and now I have two modulators. I have a small Korg module that you can use, Connect the signal with the instrument cable, or just adjust the microphone. I also have an air conditioner on the Bosa TU-3 pedal. If I chat or play programs with my friends, I will I use TU-3 to keep the rhythm. It's very durable and accurate. I like the way I step on it and coordinate and turn off the guitar signal so that I can tune quietly. Disturb my friends and / or audience. In family practice, I use Korg because I usually make adjustments before the game, then plug in my training amplifier and start. Ko RG is very good and accurate. It is easy to use alternately for customization. It can be used after 9 years (including buying jam before leaving the factory) , I just need to buy a substitute. A year ago, when a friend of mine went to buy an electronic regulator, I first saw a guy in the guitar store and convinced him that he was in t He's not very satisfied. It's not only a little unusual, but also a big blue sphere sitting on your head seems a little fragile, and it's not so for me. OSTO is used to it. Although, I think the idea of creating a resonator that can work with your guitar will be cool, and it seems that this is a plan and should be completed before then It solves the problem that my friends and I don't like? That's a good thing. It's ahead of snake. However, alternating settings are not easy, so it's important to remember this. In addition, it will take some time to get used to these letters, Because they use such a bulky LCD block style on some DVD players. It's not a big complaint, but it's not as stupid as my tree root or tu-3.2. Appearance / easy to use NIA: it's much more exquisite than Snaker. It can hide behind your spindle. It's much better than the blue ball at the end of the guitar. The only problem is if you have a gearbox ""Les Paul"" style , there are three modules on each side, and it may be difficult for you to find the right position for modulation, as you can see. Selection is the end of the main cell. I put the guitar low to find a place to see from top to bottom, but those who are slightly higher than the guitar may not be lucky. However , there should be no problem with their front body, which will work well for them. Moreover, it is very light, so it is obviously not a problem. Durability: This is the main disadvantage of ET Their regulator. The serpentine hook is easy to break because it is located in part of the ball. The planetary wave Mini won't easily lose its head, but the ratchet is made of plastic and I don't want it to stay there Shkom often. The regulator itself is made of fairly light plastic, so it's good to put it in your pocket on the way to jam, but I still think it's easy to break. I don't have enough time for this to happen, so I can only give you a preliminary impression. In any case, the choice of spindle box is better than that of solnock. However, the spindle regulator acts as a single Before working for everyone, the whole must go another way. Anyone who often speaks is best to use the foot regulator (I personally recommend Tu-2 or TU-3 or Korg pitchblack Bosa) I know they are more expensive, but in the long run, you will be happier. This is a good choice for those who are looking for a convenient means to adjust Kama conference songs. But it can't last forever. Maybe I'll stick to my TU-3 module and my Korg module, but with the development of the main module, it's better than most.",3

I've been playing guitar for nine years and I have two other tuners. I have a bit of Korg plug in type, where you can have it record your signal with an instrument cable or just use the microphone a at the front to tune up. I also have a Boss TU-3 pedal. If I'm sitting with friends or playing a show, I'll use the TU-3 to stay in harmony. It is very durable and accurate, and I like how I can step up to both turn on the tuner and turn off my guitar signal so that I can vote in silence and not annoy my friends and/or the audience. For home practice I use the basket, as I usually tune up before I start playing, then just join my practice amplifier and blow away. The basket is nice and accurate, easy enough to use for alternative tuning, and in nine years of having around (including in and out of jam sessions to buy the TU-3) I only had to buy a replacement. I first saw a headstock tuner a year ago when a friend went to get an electronic tuner and the man in the guitar shop talked to him in that blue Snark that everyone seems to have nowadays. He wasn't too happy about it. Not only was it a bit flashy to have a big blue ball on your headstock, it seemed pretty skinny to me and it wasn't easy to agree with. While I thought the idea of a tuner working on the resonance of your guitar would be cool, it seemed like the design of a bit of a way to go before it was something I would want on my headstock. Enter this Mini Headsock Tuner through Planet Waves. Did it solve the problems that made Snark so unattractive to my friend and me? 1. Accuracy: It seems to be exactly right, that is a good thing, and it is already putting this before the Snark. It is not easy to use for alternative tuning however, so keep that in mind. Also, the letters take a little getting used to, because they use that kind of chunky LCD block style that you find on some DVD players. Not much of a complaint, but it's not as stupid evidence as my Korg or TU-3.2. Looks/Ease Of Use: It is a bit more subtle than the Snark, able to hide behind your headstock, which is much better than having a blue ball at the end of your guitar. The only problem with hiding behind the back of your headstock is if you have a Les Paul headstock style where you have three tuners on either side, you may have trouble finding a place where the tuner actually fits and can be seen. My LP copy has the larger Grover tuners so my only choice is at the end of the headstock. I carry my guitar pretty low, so I could find an area where I can see it from top to bottom, but those who put it a little higher can be unlucky. Those with Fender style should not have a problem, but it will work well for them. Also, it's bright enough, so seeing it well enough won't be a problem. 3. Durability: This is where the main disadvantage for these types of tuners are. The Snark is very easy to break, because it rests on a small ball joint. This Planet Waves mini is not going to lose its head too easily, but the rattling clip is made of plastic and I don't expect it to use too much. The tuner itself is made of pretty light plastic too, so as nice as it would be to put this in your pocket on the way to a jam session, I still think it's easy enough to break. I haven't had it long enough to make this happen, so I can only give you my first impressions. Let's just say, I would never perform with this man as my only tuner. It's obviously not gonna be tough enough for that kind of use. All in all, it's a better headstock choice than the Snark. However, main tuners as a whole have one more way to go before they start working for everyone. Anyone who performs often would be better off to get some kind of pedal tuner (I personally suggest a Boss TU-2 or TU-3 or a Korg Pitchbreck). I know they're more expensive, but you'll be happier in the long run. Those who are looking for a convenient way to tune in between the songs during a jam session, this is a fun option. But it may not last forever. I'll probably stick to my TU-3 and my Korg plug-in, but if headstock tuners go, this is more fun than most.",3

I've been playing guitar for the last nine years, and I've got two other tuners at the moment. I have a small basket plug in the type where you can record your signal with an instrument cable or simply use the microphone at the front to switch on. I also have a boss TU-3 pedal tuner.

The basket is beautiful and precise, simple enough to use alternative tunings, and in nine years, in and out of jam sessions before buying the TU-3, I only had to buy a replacement. I saw a headstock tuner a year ago when a friend tried to get an electronic tuner and the guy at the guitar store talked him into the blue snark that everybody seems to have these days.

While I thought the idea of having a tuner work out the resonance of your guitar would be cool, it seemed like the design would go a little further before it was something I wanted on my headstand. Enter this Mini Headstock Tuner from Planet Waves. Does it make the problems that the snail made so unattractive to me and my friend? 1. Precision: It seems to be accurate, that is a good thing, and it is already presenting this before the Snark. It is not easy to use for alternative tunings however, so please note this. Also the letters need to get used to it because they have this kind of Chunky LCD block style that you find on some DVD players. Not a big complaint, but it's not as idiotic as my basket or TU-3.2. Look/Ease Of Use: It is slightly more subtle than the Snark, able to hide behind your headstand, which is quite preferable to having a blue ball at the end of your guitar. The only problem with hiding behind the headstand is if you have a read Paul style headstock where you have three tuners on each side, you may have difficulty finding a place where the tuner actually fits and can be seen.

5568,"I'll be honest and honest right now and say I'm not the biggest fan of acoustics. I like the idea, but I usually feel that execution is not desirable. But when this came up in Vine's newsletter, I thought I'd give him a chance to see if it made some of the things I don't like about others. A little background first, I guess. I've been playing guitar for the last nine years, and I currently have two other musicians. I have a small type of Korg plug, where you can have it pick up your signal with an organ cable or just use the microphone at the front to coordinate. I also have a chief TU-3 pedal coordinator. If I'm playing with friends or playing a show, TU-3 is what I'm gonna use to stay in tune. It's very resilient and expensive, and I like the way I can step on it to activate the coordinator and cut off my guitar signal, so that I can coordinate quietly and not disturb my friends and/or the public. For practice at home, I use Korg, like I usually wind up before I start playing, and then I just plug in my amp and go. Korg is nice and expensive, easy enough to use for alternative tones, and in nine years I've had it around (including in and out of jam sessions before buying TU-3) I first saw a headset a year ago when a friend went to get an electronic coordinator and the guy at the guitar store Not only was it a little fancy to have a big blue ball in your head, but it was a little bit of a big blue ball in your head. I thought it was kind of impossible, and it wasn't easy enough to coordinate with that, but I thought the idea of having a co-ordinator that worked with your guitar performance would be good, food. It was that the plan had a little way to go before it was something I wanted to put in my head. Insert this Planet Waves Mini Headstock Tuner. Fix the problems that made Snark so repulsive for me Accuracy seems to be accurate, it's a good thing, and it's already putting that in front of Snark. However, it's not easy to use for alternative tones, so Also, letters take a while to get used to, as they use this kind of partial-style LCD block that you find on some DVD players. It's not a big deal. It's a little more discreet than Snark, which can be hidden behind the mantress, which is better than having to have The only problem with hiding behind your head is that if you have a Les Paul-type cuff link where you have three tunes on each side, you can't get out of it. You might have a problem finding a place where the coordinator really fits and can be seen. My LP has Grover's biggest musicians, so my only choice is I'm wearing my guitar pretty low, so I was able to find an area where I can see it from top to bottom, but those who throw it a little higher can be Those who have Fender-style manatees won't have a problem, but it'll do them good. Also, it's quite bright, so seeing it well enough won't be an issue. The Snark is very easy to break, as it is based on a small ball joint. This mini planet Waves will not lose its head It's very easy, but the clip is made of plastic and I don't expect it to hold under too much use. The coordinator himself is made of quite light plastic, so as nice and If you're gonna keep that in your pocket on the way to a jam session, I still think it would be easy to break. Let's just say this, I would never play with this guy as my only co-ordinator. It's obvious it won't be hard enough for such a Generally speaking, it's a better choice in the head than Snork.

5569,"I'm frankly not the biggest fan of the gear regulator. I like the idea, but usually I feel a little dissatisfied with its implementation. But does this book solve what I hate in other books (* cough * cough *). I want to point out the background first I've been playing the guitar for the past nine years and now I have two other adjusters. There is a small Korg plug-in type. The signal and machine cables can be adjusted at the front or using a microphone. I also have a boss TU-3 pedal adjuster. If I am chatting with my friends or performing a show, I will keep the rhythm with TU-3. It's very tough and accurate. I like how I step on it and cut off the regulator and my guitar signal at the same time. So I can adjust my voice quietly without disturbing my friends or audience. I use Korg in family exercises Because I usually make adjustments before I start playing, insert my practice amplifier and launch. Korg is good and accurate and can be easily used for rotation coordination. After 9 years of use (including jam in and out before TU-3 purchase), it's OK to buy a substitute. When my friend went to buy an electronic scheduler a year ago, I saw the scheduler for the first time. The guy in other stores persuaded him and let him fall into the depression that everyone has now. He is not very satisfied with this. It's not only a little gorgeous, but also a huge blue ball sitting on your head. It seems a little weak. It's not easy for me to coordinate with it. Although I think there is an idea of adjustment period, you will resonate well with the guitar. It seems to have been designed before going some way. That's why I want to be my leader. Planetary waves entering this mini head adjuster. Does it solve the problem that neither I nor my friends like? 1. Accuracy: it can really be well coordinated. This is a good thing and makes it ahead of Sparta. But alternating coordination is not easy, so be sure to remember this. In addition, these letters also use some bulky LCD block styles of DVD players, so it will take some time to get familiar with them. This is not a big complaint, but it is not as stupid as my Korg or tu-3.2. Appearance / ease of use: more subtle than snark. It can be hidden behind the spindle. This is much better than putting a blue ball on the tip of the guitar. The only problem is that if there is a Les Paul style trunk with three regulators next to it, it is difficult for the regulator to find a really suitable position. My LP replica has a larger Grover adjuster, so the only option is the end of the spindle. I put my guitar very low and can find a place to look down from the top, but people who play higher may have bad luck. The damp proof board box should be OK. Although it is great to work for them. Moreover, because it is very bright, it is not a problem to see fully. Durability: the main disadvantage of these regulators. A snake hook is easy to break when it rests on a small ball. Although this platinum wave Mini is not easy to lose hair, the ratchet clip is made of plastic and doesn't want to maintain it even if it is used too much. The tuner itself is also made of fairly light plastic, so it's better to put it in your pocket on the way to the jam meeting, but I still think it's easy to break. I don't have enough time to do all this, so I can only give you my preliminary impression. So, I never saw this guy as my only mediator. It is obviously not strong enough for this purpose. In a word, we chose a better headstock - beasnake. But the headstock adjuster as a whole still has a way to go before working for everyone. People who often perform had better use the pedal adjuster. (I personally recommend using boss Tu-2 or TU-3 or Korg pitchblack.) I know they are more expensive, but in the long run, you will be happier. This is a good choice for those who find a convenient way to coordinate songs during the Kam conference. But it won't last forever. I can stick to my TU-3 and my Korg plug-in, but with the development of the head adjuster, it's better than most people.",3

In order for it to work, you must put it on your head (next to the nut) and move a rope loudly to get a consistent range. Put it on the top of the headdress, it doesn't pick up enough string vibrations to record well. The problem with putting it next to the nut is that it's impossible to hang the guitar on the guitar stand on the wall. This seems to be a small problem... But if you often use such a device (like many home players), it won't. Myself, there are five guitars hanging on the wall of my living room. That doesn't mean it's worthless. You can clip it to the top of the headdress at any time and move it when you are ready to tune. So I gave it three stars. However, there are other more sensitive tuners, such as the capo tuner we recently saw on Amazon. They cost about the same (in fact, capo tuners are a little cheaper), but I found that capo tuners respond much faster. So, in the final analysis, I have no impression. Relatively speaking, this is not an expensive tuner, which is good. But they ""really didn't do that well"". They're slow. To be honest, I think one might break a string before realizing that the tuner doesn't respond to the current plucking. Please note that clapping guitarist: This is not your clip tuner.

To get it one must place on the headpiece, beside the nut, and stray a fairly large string for consistent registration. It simply places the top of the headpiece that does not pick up enough string vibration to register. The problem of putting it next to the nut is that it is impossible to hang the guitar on the wall mount guitar hanger. It seems like a small problem. But if you're not using such devices regularly (many home players). I have five guitars on the wall of my living room. That's not worth it. You can always clip at the top of the headpiece and move it when you're ready to tune. So I give it three stars. But there are other more sensitive tuners like duck tuners we recently saw on Amazon. They are almost the same price (in fact, the duck tuner is a little cheap), but I found the capo tuner quite sensitive. So the bottom line, I won't be touched. These are not relatively expensive tuners. But they really don't do all that great job. They honestly believe that the person may break the string before realizing that the tuner does not respond to the current string pack. Note to ovation guitar players: This is not a tuner clip for you. There is no place to clip it. Luckily my ovation does built-in tuning but you need a different tuner if you have ovation sound.",3
5573,"This is a unique, subtle and very useful product, if accurate. The problem is that his reaction is not flexible enough. To work, you have to put it on your head (on the nut) and pull the rope out loud to get a coherent sound field. Put it on the top of the headdress, it just doesn't pick up enough string vibration to fix it well. The problem is to put it next to the nut, so it's impossible to hang the guitar on the wall. This seems to be a small problem But if you often use such devices (like many home players), this will not happen. Myself, there are five guitars hanging in my living room. This does not mean that it is useless. You can place it on the top of the headdress at any time and move it when you are ready to set it up. So I gave him three stars. However, there are other more sensitive regulators, such as Kapo we recently saw at Amazon. Their prices are almost the same (in fact, the capo regulator is a little cheaper), but I find that the capo regulator reacts much faster. So I couldn't feel anything in the end. In contrast, this is not an expensive regulator, which is a good thing. But they are ""not that good"". They don't respond. To be honest, I think a person may break a string before he realizes that the regulator doesn't respond to the current dial. Please note that clapping for the guitarist: This is not your editor. There is no place to cut. Fortunately, I have a built-in setting, but if you have an ovation acoustics, you need another controller.",3
5574,"This product is unique, small and would be very useful... if it was more accurate. The problem is it's not responding well enough. To get it working you have to place the layer on the chapter (next to the note) and make a string hard for a consistent register. Putting it on the top of the chapter, it just doesn't pick up enough string vibration to register properly. The problem with placing next to the note is that it then makes it impossible to hang the guitar on a wall-mount guitar hanger. That might seem like a small problem... but not if you use such a device regularly (as many home players do). I've got five guitars on my wall. That doesn't make this worthless. You can always clamp it on the top of the chapter and then move it when you are ready to vote. So I give it three stars. But there are other listeners, like the capo tuners we've seen on Amazon lately. They are about the same price (actually the capo tuners are a little less expensive) but I found the capo tuners considerably more responsive. So in the end, I'm not impressed. This is not an expensive tuner compared, and that's good. But they're not doing such a good job. They're not responding enough that I think someone might break a string before he realizes the tuner isn't responding to the current string.

To make it run, you have to put it deep on the headboard (next to the mother) and stumble a string quite loudly for a consistent register.

The problem with placing next to the mother is that it makes it impossible to hang the guitar on a wall holder.

That's not an expensive coordinator compared to talking, and that's good. But they're not doing a very good job. They don't react enough that I honestly believe that someone can break a string before they realize that the coordinator isn't responding to the current coach.

5650,"I use this little guy to connect with my Daw and digital piano. I transmit the piano sound to the line input port through the balanced cable for recording. I also run the VST device on the Daw, trigger it from the piano through USB MIDI, and use the device for digital / audio conversion. I listened through sennheser hd595 headphones and connected some studio monitors with a balanced cable. I bought this to upgrade my previous audio interface, Bellinger uf0202. The device also works well in this regard, but two things are missing: the volume knob and the balanced input / output. The volume knob is a problem I can solve, but my current monitor seems to be easily affected by the grounding loop (even if there is a grounding lifting plug), so I need to use a balanced cable. I'm glad I did it. The balanced cable completely eliminates my noise problem. This is a good deal. However, I would say to anyone who doesn't need a balanced cable that they should consider berinda. This is only a small part of the price, and the effect is very good. In addition, this is a class complaint, so you don't have to use Bellinger's driver. It is plug and play. I have some good things to say about focus Scarlett 2I2 (all about hardware) and some bad things to say (all about software). I tried using the driver version 2.1 that came with the disk and udpated 2.2 that I downloaded from the focus website. Let you know what I need in the interface: 1. Balanced stereo I / O 2. High quality headphones amp3. Headphone amplifier and volume knob of main line 4. Good digital to analog conversion 5. Low output delay (input delay is not important to me) I don't use microphone preamplifier, which is a big selling point of the device. Good ===================================================================. It does what you want, has very convenient control, and has high-quality construction. I am very satisfied with the conversion from digital to analog. It has a large volume knob and another headphone amplifier. It has switches, so each input can be a line input or a microphone preamplifier. It has a zero delay monitoring switch (to monitor everything coming)* I especially care about headphone amplifiers. I often use headphones. Poor headphone amplifier may be a big problem. Bellinger headphone amplifier is only normal. Specifically, its output impedance is 50 ohms. The rule of thumb for good headphone / amplifier matching is that the output impedance should be 1 / 8 of the headphone impedance - my HD 595 has an impedance of 50 ohms. If you break this rule, you will get the distortion of frequency response. In my example, this mainly means the attenuation of bass. Most manufacturers do not list their output impedance, probably because they are embarrassed. Anyway, focusrite does this, which is one of the reasons why I trust them more. The output impedance is less than 10 ohms - respectable, but not surprising. In principle, it's still not as low as I need, but I can notice that the bass response of the headset has improved. There's a lot of extra voltage here, so I can open a high impedance can when necessary. Anyway, good headphone amplifier. Check* Balanced inputs and outputs work very well. The inputs and outputs can accommodate 1 / 4 TRS style inputs and xlrs. The light around them shows that something really came in, emitting a red light when it was in danger of being cut off. There are many benefits. I almost turned them upside down. The output is TRS style (balanced or unbalanced) and is located on the back* I like the appearance of this box. It has a red metal shell. It is strong at the front and back and attractive* The USB cable is just a type B port. This means that if it is damaged or something else, you can replace it. For example, the Bellinger is hardwired to its cable... Annoying king* It is powered by a bus. In fact, if I had a wart, I would be fine, but it's easier. I don't complain about the hardware at all. The driver of this thing is very bad under Windows XP. I have a clean installation. I haven't installed anything except my Daw software, Acrobat Reader and this driver. I mean, my computer is really rudimentary. The performance of using Bellinger is very good. The delay time using BEHRINGER (the time between playing a note and hearing a note from the speaker) is 8 milliseconds, which is actually imperceptible. Unfortunately, the focus driver, although technically ASIO, does not have any acceptable latency. The minimum delay I can set is 23 milliseconds. At this level, the instrument starts to sound very slow and lagging. It is very difficult, at least for me, to work with such a big delay. When I decided to install asio4all as a last resort, I was ready to return the device. This is an ASIO driver if you absolutely can't make the manufacturer's driver execute at a decent level. I installed it and it worked. The output delay is only 4.3 milliseconds (of which only 0.3 milliseconds is the actual output delay, so this is really impressive). My conclusion is that the hardware of this machine is very good, but the software is very bad. Unfortunately, you can't actually uninstall the focusrite driver because otherwise windows doesn't recognize the device, and it's never even turned on -- unlike BEHRINGER, it doesn't conform to the class. So now that I have installed two drivers, I only use one of them. The bad news is that there are many errors in this configuration. Generally speaking, when I turn on the computer and try to play my VST instrument, all I get is crackle and bang until I open the ASIO configuration panel and increase the buffer. Interestingly, it doesn't matter where the buffer starts. I always increase the buffer before making any good sound. I can start with a huge buffer - a lot of latency - it will burst until I open it and further increase the buffer. I have to do this every time I turn on the computer. In addition, sometimes if I let it drive for a while and then come back, it will crackle again until I take another step. We're talking about the main bugs here. I decided to give up asio4all and try to get the focus driver back to work - maybe I'm missing a setting. When I tried to set the buffer size, I heard an explosion, and then my computer restarted. When it comes back, I can't make a good sound, even if I turn up the buffer. Tried to restart several times and still failed. So I uninstalled and reinstalled the focusrite software. At first it didn't work. I also have to install asio4all. Now I can get sound from it half the time. I hope you understand. These drivers are terrible. A bad monkey could have written a better driver. If it weren't for the fact that the device worked very, very well when all the stars were aligned and the driver recognized the drive and allowed it to play, I would give it a star. I think I'm willing to sacrifice convenience and stability for good hardware. I will never use it on site or when time is tight. The advantage of drivers is that they can be updated and repaired. I hope so. They have made a modification to the driver, which is surprising, because even the 2.2 driver is very annoying, just like 2.1. The last idea is ===================================================================================. The BEHRINGER driver has been working normally, but if you move the interface from one USB port to another, it will no longer be recognized and you must reinstall the driver. However, you do not need to use the Bellinger driver. Asio4all will give you 11 milliseconds without any complications. This is as trouble free as I have seen in such devices. If you read about PreSonus audiobox USB and M-Audio fast track pro (probably the two closest competitors of focus), you will get a lot of comments, like this one... Terrible, terrible drivers have never been repaired. In fact, McGee is also a competitor, agate Blackjack - but comments on it suggest that the driver may be worse than this one. Unfortunately, no professional music manufacturer cares about their drivers, so we have to endure an unstable system that can only work half the time. Maybe it's better under Mac. I don't know. Interestingly, this is indeed the only USB 2.0 device in this range. Considering how long the USB 2.0 standard has existed, this is quite shocking. The only real meaning is that USB 1.1 devices, such as M-Audio and PreSonus, can only carry out 24 / 96 audio input or output of two channels, rather than input or output of two channels at the same time. Insufficient throughput in USB 1.1. So from a competitive point of view, focusrite looks ok. Unfortunately, all audio interface manufacturers - at least in this range of devices - believe that good hardware and (especially) good software are not needed. At least the hardware in this paragraph meets the specification requirements. We can pray for better drivers in the future. Bottom line: This is a magical five-star device... If you can keep the software working. If your budget is tight or you don't care about the balance of income and expenditure, I suggest you choose Bellinger uca202 or ufo2020. They are cheaper, more advanced and have better drivers. If you are using high impedance headphones, even the headphone amplifier is very good. Update Date: May 2012 =================================== since the above content was written, a new version 2.3 of the driver came out. The new driver actually works. I've stopped using asio4all, and I've got a pretty good delay. Occasionally -- not very often -- it inexplicably asks me to edit settings and increase buffers, and it restarts my computer a certain percentage of the time I do so. If I don't make any changes, it works normally in most cases. I would never use it in a mission critical environment (for example, improvisation or professional work), but it is now good enough for my family. If you have a problem with the driver, please confirm",3

It has switches, so each input can be a line input or a microphone preamplifier. It has a zero delay monitoring switch (to monitor everything coming)* I especially care about headphone amplifiers. I often use headphones. Poor headphone amplifier may be a big problem. Bellinger headphone amplifier is only normal. Specifically, its output impedance is 50 ohms. The rule of thumb for good headphone / amplifier matching is that the output impedance should be 1 / 8 of the headphone impedance - my HD 595 has an impedance of 50 ohms. If you break this rule, you will get the distortion of frequency response. In my example, this mainly means the attenuation of bass. Most manufacturers do not list their output impedance, probably because they are embarrassed. Anyway, focusrite does this, which is one of the reasons why I trust them more. The output impedance is less than 10 ohms - respectable, but not surprising. In principle, it's still not as low as I need, but I can notice that the bass response of the headset has improved. There's a lot of extra voltage here, so I can open a high impedance can when necessary. Anyway, good headphone amplifier. Check* Balanced inputs and outputs work very well. The inputs and outputs can accommodate 1 / 4 TRS style inputs and xlrs. The light around them shows that something really came in, emitting a red light when it was in danger of being cut off. There are many benefits. I almost turned them upside down. The output is TRS style (balanced or unbalanced) and is located on the back* I like the appearance of this box. It has a red metal shell. It is strong at the front and back and attractive* The USB cable is just a type B port. This means that if it is damaged or something else, you can replace it. For example, the Bellinger is hardwired to its cable... Annoying king* It is powered by a bus. In fact, if I had a wart, I would be fine, but it's easier. I don't complain about the hardware at all. The driver of this thing is very bad under Windows XP. I have a clean installation. I haven't installed anything except my Daw software, Acrobat Reader and this driver. I mean, my computer is really rudimentary. The performance of using Bellinger is very good. The delay time using BEHRINGER (the time between playing a note and hearing a note from the speaker) is 8 milliseconds, which is actually imperceptible. Unfortunately, the focus driver, although technically ASIO, does not have any acceptable latency. The minimum delay I can set is 23 milliseconds. At this level, the instrument starts to sound very slow and lagging. It is very difficult, at least for me, to work with such a big delay. When I decided to install asio4all as a last resort, I was ready to return the device. This is an ASIO driver if you absolutely can't make the manufacturer's driver execute at a decent level. I installed it and it worked. The output delay is only 4.3 milliseconds (of which only 0.3 milliseconds is the actual output delay, so this is really impressive). My conclusion is that the hardware of this machine is very good, but the software is very bad. Unfortunately, you can't actually uninstall the focusrite driver because otherwise windows doesn't recognize the device, and it's never even turned on -- unlike BEHRINGER, it doesn't conform to the class. So now that I have installed two drivers, I only use one of them. The bad news is that there are many errors in this configuration. Generally speaking, when I turn on the computer and try to play my VST instrument, all I get is crackle and bang until I open the ASIO configuration panel and increase the buffer. Interestingly, it doesn't matter where the buffer starts. I always increase the buffer before making any good sound. I can start with a huge buffer - a lot of latency - it will burst until I open it and further increase the buffer. I have to do this every time I turn on the computer. In addition, sometimes if I let it drive for a while and then come back, it will crackle again until I take another step. We're talking about the main bugs here. I decided to give up asio4all and try to get the focus driver back to work - maybe I'm missing a setting. When I tried to set the buffer size, I heard an explosion, and then my computer restarted. When it comes back, I can't make a good sound, even if I turn up the buffer. Tried to restart several times and still failed. So I uninstalled and reinstalled the focusrite software. At first it didn't work. I also have to install asio4all. Now I can get sound from it half the time. I hope you understand. These drivers are terrible. A bad monkey could have written a better driver. If it weren't for the fact that the device worked very, very well when all the stars were aligned and the driver recognized the drive and allowed it to play, I would give it a star. I think I'm willing to sacrifice convenience and stability for good hardware. I will never use it on site or when time is tight. The advantage of drivers is that they can be updated and repaired. I hope so. They have made a modification to the driver, which is surprising, because even the 2.2 driver is very annoying, just like 2.1. The last idea is ===================================================================================. The BEHRINGER driver has been working normally, but if you move the interface from one USB port to another, it will no longer be recognized and you must reinstall the driver. However, you do not need to use the Bellinger driver. Asio4all will give you 11 milliseconds without any complications. This is as trouble free as I have seen in such devices. If you read about PreSonus audiobox USB and M-Audio fast track pro (probably the two closest competitors of focus), you will get a lot of comments, like this one... Terrible, terrible drivers have never been repaired. In fact, McGee is also a competitor, agate Blackjack - but comments on it suggest that the driver may be worse than this one. Unfortunately, no professional music manufacturer cares about their drivers, so we have to endure an unstable system that can only work half the time. Maybe it's better under Mac. I don't know. Interestingly, this is indeed the only USB 2.0 device in this range. Considering how long the USB 2.0 standard has existed, this is quite shocking. The only real meaning is that USB 1.1 devices, such as M-Audio and PreSonus, can only carry out 24 / 96 audio input or output of two channels, rather than input or output of two channels at the same time. Insufficient throughput in USB 1.1. So from a competitive point of view, focusrite looks ok. Unfortunately, all audio interface manufacturers - at least in this range of devices - believe that good hardware and (especially) good software are not needed. At least the hardware in this paragraph meets the specification requirements. We can pray for better drivers in the future. Bottom line: This is a magical five-star device... If you can keep the software working. If your budget is tight or you don't care about the balance of income and expenditure, I suggest you choose Bellinger uca202 or ufo2020. They are cheaper, more advanced and have better drivers. If you are using high impedance headphones, even the headphone amplifier is very good. Update Date: May 2012 =================================== since the above content was written, a new version 2.3 of the driver came out. The new driver actually works. I've stopped using asio4all, and I've got a pretty good delay. Occasionally -- not very often -- it inexplicably asks me to edit settings and increase buffers, and it restarts my computer a certain percentage of the time I do so. If I don't make any changes, it works normally in most cases. I would never use it in a mission critical environment (for example, improvisation or professional work), but it is now good enough for my family. If you have a problem with the driver, please confirm",3

5656,"I'm using this little man in connection with my DAW and digital piano. I run the pianos through balanced cables in the line-in ports for recording, and I also run VST intruders on my DAW which I activate via USB MIDI from the piano and use this device for digital/audio conversion. I am listening through Sennheser HD 595 headphones connected to this and I have also confirmed a number of studio monitors using balanced cables. I bought this to upgrade from my previous audio interface, the Controller UF0202. That device also worked well for this purpose, but lacked two things: a volume knob, and balanced in/out. The volume button thing I could work around, but my current monitors seem susceptible to ground loops (even with a ground lift plug), so I had to go with balanced cables. I'm glad you did. The balanced cables have completely eliminated my sound problems. This was a good buy. However, I would like to say to anyone who does not need balanced cables and is on a budget that they should consider the Behringer. It is a small fraction of the price and it works quite well. It's also a complaint, so you don't have to use Behringer's drivers. It's plug-and-play. I have some good things to say about the Focustite Scarlett 2i2 (all about the hardware) and some bad things (all about the software). I tried to use the driver version 2.1, which came with the disk, and the designated 2.2, which I downloaded from the Focusrite website. To let you know what I need in an interface:1. Stereo balance in/out2. High quality headphones amp3. Volume buttons for the main phone amplifier and for the main line 4. Good digital-analogue conversion5. Low output latency (import latency not important to me) I do not use the Mic preamps, which is one of the major sales points of this device. The Good ====== This box is simple and well designed. It does what you want, has very handy controls, and has high build quality. I welcome the digital analogue conversion. It has a large volume knob and another for the main phone amplifier. It has switches so that any input can be a line-in or microphone pre-amp. It has a nullatency monitoring switch (from whatever comes in)* The main phone amplifier was of particular importance to me. I use a lot of headphones and a bad headphone amplifier can be quite a problem. The Behringer headphone amplifier was only good. Specifically, it has an output impedance of 50 ohms. The rule of thumb for good headphones/amp s matching is that the output impedance 1/8 must be the impedance of the headphones--my HD 595's have fifty ohms of impedance. Breaking this rule will give you distortions of the frequency response. In my case, this mainly meant weakening the base. Most manufacturers don't name their impedance output, maybe because they're ashamed. Anyway, Focustite does, which is why I trust them a little more. The initial impedance is less than ten ohms, respectable but not surprising. Still not as low as I would need in principle, but I can see an improvement in the base response in my headphones. There's a lot of extra tension here, so I can control higher impedance pins if necessary. Anyway, good headphone amplifier. Check! Balanced ins and outs work very well, the ins fit a 1/4 TRS style in and XLR. The light around them shows when something comes in and shines red when it is in danger of being cut. There's a lot of profit available. I almost turned them all the way down. The outputs are TRS style (balanced or unbalanced) and are located at the back.* I like the look of the box, with a red metal box, and the front and back are robust and attractive too."" The USB cable is only a type B port. This means you can replace it if it gets damaged or whatever. The Behringer, for example, was connected to his cable... King of annoying. It's bus-powered. I could have used a wart, but this is even easier. I really don't have any complaints about the hardware. The Bad ======== The driver for this thing is terrible under Windows XP. I have a clean installation with nothing installed except my DAW software, acrobat reader, and this driver. I mean, my computer's really scratched. The performance with the Behringer was good. The latency (time between playing a note and hearing the speakers) was eight ms with the help of the Controller, which is not really noticeable. Unfortunately, although technically ASIO, the focus route driver does not seem to have an acceptable latency. The lowest latency I could turn it on and get sound off instead of crackles and pops was 23 Ms. At that level the instrument starts to sound very slow and slow. It's very difficult for me to work with such a big latency. I was ready to return this device when I decided to last attempt to install ASIO4ALL. That is a kind of ASIO driver to use if you absolutely cannot let the manufacturer's driver perform at a decent level. I installed it and it worked. The latency of the output was a small 4.3 ms (of which only.3 are actually outputlatency, so this is really impressive). I conclude that the hardware is very good in this machine, but the software is terrible. Unfortunately, you cannot remove the Focusrite driver, otherwise the windows will not recognize the device and will never turn it on. It doesn't conform to the class, unlike the Behringer. So now I have two drivers installed for it, just one of which I use. The bad news is that this configuration is very buggy. In general, when I turn on the computer and try to play my VST instrument, all I get is cracks and folds until I open the ASIO configuration panel and enlarge the buffer. Funny thing is, no matter where the buffer starts, I always have to raise it before I make good noises. I can start it with a huge buffer, a lot of latency, and it will burst until I open it and enlarge the buffer even further. I have to do this every time I turn on the computer. Also, sometimes when I leave it on and come back, it'll be crispy again until I enlarge it one more step. We're talking about big bugs here. I decided to dump ASIO4ALL and try to get the focus drive back to work. Maybe I missed something. When I was trying to determine the buffer size, I heard the sound of an explosion and then my computer was rebooted. When it came back, I couldn't get any good noises, not even when I turned the buffer up. I tried to start over a few more times, but it still didn't work. So I reinstalled the focused software. It didn't work at first. I had to install ASIO4ALL, too, and now I can get some kind of sounds out of it, half the time. I hope you understand. These drivers are terrible. Terrible. A monkey could have written a better driver. I would give it a 1-star if it wasn't for the fact that the device works very well when all the stars are aligned and the driver recognizes the disk and allows it to play. I think I'm willing to sacrifice ease and stability for beautiful hardware when it works. I would never use this in a living situation or when time is critical. The good thing about drivers is that they can update and repair them. Well, I hope so. They've already reviewed the driver once, which is amazing, because even the 2.2 driver is seriously a horror, just like the 2.1. Final Thoughts ========= Unfortunately, there is really no USB interface with a good driver. The Behringer driver always worked, but when you moved the interface from one USB port to another, it was no longer recognized and you had to reinstall the driver. However, you did not have to use the Controller driver and ASIO4ALL would give you 11 ms and perform without complications. Well, that's pretty straightforward when I've seen this kind of equipment. If you read about the Presonus Audiobox USB and the M-Audio Fast Track Pro (probably the two closest competitors of this focus line), what you get is a lot of comments like this... terrible, terrible drivers who are never repaired. Actually, Mackie's also making a competitor, the Onyx Blackjack... But the reviews of that show show show show that the driver may be even worse than this one. Unfortunately, none of the pro-music manufacturers care about their drivers, so we have to live with unstable systems that only work half the time. Maybe it's better under Mac. I don't know. I don't know. Interestingly, this is actually the only USB 2.0 device in this range. That's pretty shocking considering how long the USB 2.0 standard has been around. The only real implication of this is that USB 1.1 devices such as the M-Audio and Presonus can only play two channels 24/96 audio in or out, not both at the same time. There's not enough transit in USB 1.1. So in light of the competition, the Focustite looks good. Unfortunately, all audio-interface manufacturers, at least in this range of devices, think that there is no need for good hardware and (above all) good software. At least the hardware in this state meets the specifications. We can cross our fingers for improved drivers in the future. The bottom line is this is a fantastic 5-star device... if you can make the software work consistently. If you're on a tight budget or you don't care about balance, I suggest you choose the Controller UCA02 or UFO2020. They're tons cheaper, class action, and they have better drivers. If you use a high-impedance headphone with it, even the headphone amplifier is pretty good on that one. Update May 2012 ===A new version of the driver, 2.3, came out since",3

5732,"Editor: I had to lower my star rating, so I revised my comment - the following is a complete explanation, but in short, it's not as good for me as sn-1. Background - I also have the original sn-1 for several years. The ball socket on the back of the tuning head soon broke, because I forgot to take it out of the spindle box before putting it into the gig bag (protec contego semi-rigid hybrid box, the space around the spindle box is a little more than the ordinary cushion bag). I did a repair and the effect was good, but I think I should change it again. However, apart from the broken socket, this is one of the best tuners I have ever used. Very fast and intuitive. Bright and easy to read under all lighting conditions. Fast response of all strings, including bass B of several five string bass. Although I think there is a weakness in the design (fragile socket), I still feel very good about the function of the product, so I ordered another one, this time sn-8 (b) ""super tight"" tuner. I decided to use another model, hoping that the new model will have better reinforcement of the ball socket (so it may be ""super tight""). Except for the obvious color difference, sn-8 is almost the same as the original. Then the fixture looks the same, and there seems to be no greater clamping force that I can detect. However, when you turn it on, the display is completely different. Basically, it's more ""to the point"". The indicator bars (""homology"", dead center) on both sides of the center distance are wider and fewer, which means that the display granularity is smaller and the accuracy is lower, but it is easy to see at a glance in any light. This may be a mixed blessing, but the good side is that it is brighter, simpler and may adjust dynamically faster. The disadvantage is that it is not granular enough to say and recite the bridge of musical instruments. Its response seems to be much faster. I realized that it is also mixed. Here we have missing stars. This speed also means that it responds very quickly to all inputs, which means that it seems to want to constantly change the notes it perceives. It seems more disturbing than sn-1. Unless you can completely disable other strings, it will jump frequently between notes. This is also one of my complaints about the planet waves mini head stand tuner. I have found that trying to tune with loud background music or other instruments through the loudspeaker will cause my instrument to vibrate at other frequencies - even if I succeed in silencing all other strings, it will make it more difficult to tune with sn-8. The difference between sn-8 and sn-1 is very obvious. For this reason, I just ordered another sn-1. I can't say how this tuner will work for other instruments because I'm a bass player. I'm not sure if there are defects or flaws here. Maybe it doesn't meet my expectations (it's set high because of my excellent experience of the original). Simply put, my sample size is too small to be sure that this is a bad product. All I know is that it's not very good for me.

I have tightened good repair, but the exchange was ordered in order. But except broken sockets this was one of the best tuners I've ever used. Very quick and intuitive.

Decided to go to another model with hope that a new model might be slightly enhanced with ball sockets. From the box, sn-8 is almost the same as the original one and saves for obvious color difference. Then the clamps look the same and seem to have no big clamp power I could find. However, turning the display is quite different. Basically, it's far to ""point"". Either side of the center pitch (in the ""tune"", dead center) is wider and less. And it means less granular and more accurate display, but one it is very easy to read at any glance of light. This may be a blending blessing, but the upper is it brighter, easier, and potentially faster for on the fly tuning. The drawback is not enough granular to say intonation to the instrument bridge. It also looks much faster to respond, I am also blessed with blended, where there are missing stars. The speed also means that it responds really to every input, which is thought to always change the notes it is being sensed. It is likely to be much better than sn-1. It will frequently jump between notes unless you can mute all other strings completely. It is also one of my (many) complaints about planetary wave mini head tuners. I vibrate my musical instruments with other frequencies when I try to tune up loud through background music or PA and vibrate my instrument with other frequencies - I make sns-8 and much harder tuning to mute all other strings, even if I succeed. The difference between sn-8 and sn-1 here is very remarkable. That's why I just ordered another sn-1. I can't say how this tuner works for other instruments. I have not confirmed there is no defect or defect here, perhaps it may not live in my expectations, set high by my wonderful experience. Simply put, my sampling size is too small to say, or say, declare this bad product. All I know is that it's not working very well for me.

Background - I also have the original sn-1 for several years Because the bracket behind the tuning head forgot to take it out of the spindle box before putting it into the gig bag (protec contego semi-rigid hybrid box, the space around the spindle box is more than that of the general cushion bag). I did a repair and it worked well, but I think I should change it again. But apart from the faulty socket, this is one of the best regulators I've ever used. Very fast and intuitive. Bright and easy to read under all lighting conditions. The fast response of all strings, including Wu Xianji's bass B, although I think there is a weakness in the design (fragile socket), I still think the function of the product is very good, so I ordered another one. This is the sn-8 (b) ""super tension"" adjustment period. I decided to use another model. I hope the reinforcement effect of the new model seat is better. (therefore, it may be ""super tense"".) Except for the obvious color difference, sn-8 is almost the same as the original. Moreover, the clamp doesn't seem to have the greater clamp force I can feel. But turn it on and the display will be completely different. Basically, it highlights the core. The marking lines (tuning, oblique points) on both sides of central street are wider and fewer, which means that the mouth is smaller and the accuracy is lower, but it can be seen at a glance in any light. This may be a blessing of mixed praise and criticism, but the advantage is brighter, simpler and faster dynamic adjustment. The disadvantage is that there is no granulation, which can not be said to be a bridge between musical instruments and singing. It also seemed to respond much faster, and I realized that it was mixed. Here are our missing stars. This speed means that it responds quickly to all inputs, which means that it wants to constantly change the perceived notes. That seems more disturbing than sn-1. If other strings are not used completely, notes move frequently. This is also one of my dissatisfaction with the planet wave mini head regulator. I found that when I tried the tone through the loudspeaker with loud background music or other instruments, my instrument would vibrate at different frequencies. Even if I successfully muted all other counties, it would be more difficult to use sn-8 for tone. The difference between sn-8 and sn-1 is very obvious. So I just ordered another sn-1. I can't tell how this adjuster works for other instruments. Because I'm a bass violinist. I'm not sure if there's anything wrong here. Maybe that didn't meet my expectations. (I set it high because of my excellent experience of the original.) In short, my opinion is too small to be sure that this is a bad product. All I know is that it's not good for me. If I keep the package for this product, I will consider changing it to a second sn-1 or other model. If not, it may be the regulator I gave them when others borrowed my regulator.)",3

So you're getting what they say. But for warm blue tones I could not get anywhere near my sound so that I could be pure nickel. For its 1.5 star. Guess from average 3. Forget all nickel rolled steel. Either pure nickel or these moments depending on your style. Schrading gocobalt. Pure nickel for pure / female tones, pure people! I also love dandelion pure.

I don't think they are very popular, although they are below the threshold of scrap iron. Others may have different feelings. Ernie Bauer said again that their grades are very high.

I don't think they're very versatile, though under the metal shepherd's threshold. The others might think differently. On the other hand, Ernie Ball even says they're very big. So you get what they say. However, for a warm bluesy tune I couldn't get as close to my sound as I can with the clean nickels. For that 1.5 star. Medium to three I think: Forget the nickel wound steel all together (they are really boring). Either pure nickel or this one depends on your style right now.

The textual research is really good in metal plug, traditional Sutra, guytone metal monster, expanded kimchi and big plug. A large number of high-order harmonics and power are captured. These five stars are easy. Although it is lower than the threshold of metal crusher, I think they are not universal. I believe others will feel differently. Once again, Eni Paul said their exports were high. That's why you got it. But for the warm blue tone, I can't get close to my voice like using pure nickel money.

Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty cool pedal but it's not as nice for my ears as my other two fuzzy pedals. But these pedals are about $100+ so if you just want to play with a fuzzy pedal that can do the trick. But buy from a local vendetta in case you get a lemon. In general, I think that if you really want a quality five-piece of fur, it might be better somewhere else. I own some other pedals I love, but that's okay with me.",3
5851,"I got it directly from suppliers from China. When it arrived, the volumetric tank did not work. It will only go out after about a quarter of its travel. I wanted to give up, but I started working the next day. So I don't know if this is a reasonable performance of these pedals. I also have two other kinds of hair (expanded kimchi and MXR 108 classic hair). To me, this pedal is good, but it sounds a little compressed. The octave is characterized by some useless things. Another lead job and middle cut make it make some nasal sounds. Don't get me wrong. This is a good pedal, but my ears are not as good as my other two fluffy pedals. But these pedals cost more than $100, and you may play tricks if you want to have velvet pedals. But in order not to get lemons, buy them from local businessmen. In short, I think if you really want high-quality fluffy pedals, you'd better go somewhere else. I have another Joo pedal, I like it, but it's just right for me.",3

5956,"Bottom line: Orange Mini terror is a powerful hybrid amplifier head that can drive any number of speakers. Its low wattage ensures super drive and classic British tones in your palm. Why are there only three stars? First of all, this is what I call the ""novel boutique amplifier"", because it reproduces the voice of the old British, just like the boss, but its lack of clearance is obvious. After all, it's orange, so if you want a dirty plexus sound with only one channel, this head is for you. When playing with Les Paul, I tested it with Marshall 1960a 4x12. It sounds great. I also tested it with a custom 1x12 cabinet with celesion g12h30. I can find the ""best point"" on the tone knob. For me, it's about 1 o'clock. At noon, the volume is the highest and the drive is the highest... I entered a very musical, gorgeous and completely suitable range for performance. Jimmy Hendrix, Angus young and Jimmy Page would like to tour with me. However, just as I like to eat English breakfast, I think I am a versatile player who needs a bright and pleasant clean channel and classic boxing 'cunch, we all know and love and a solid twisted metal and beyond. Unfortunately, micro terror is a small trick in the tone category, and for this (if we start with five stars), I have to subtract one star. I'm confident to subtract an asterisk from the tone, because micro terror can't control the pedal well without making too much noise, resulting in feedback. I subtracted another star, because this brain is really useful only when you already have 2x12 or 4x12 in a rock band and want something fast and small to rock. The problem is that if you are one of these people, you may already have a solid amplifier head to drive 2x12 or 4x12 in the first place. This puts micro terror in a secondary position, or when the situation worsens, micro terror can be used as an emergency command during the performance. This brings me to my last point: if you want to buy it as a leader in bedroom practice or garage rehearsal, you can get a better product at this price. It has two good channels instead of a simple (but great) channel. What I like about micro terror is that it is something you can keep in your arsenal forever. Over the years, micro terrar has many different combination amplifiers and head / cabinet variants, which can fill this gap because it can be scaled according to your performance or rehearsal needs. If I start from scratch, I may buy two 2x12 taxis, a mini terror car, and a larger and more powerful pipe head to drive two taxis (if necessary). This will provide perfect flexibility for band rehearsal, studio recording, small bar, big bar, club or concert stage. (for those who think this comment is not helpful: I have noticed this comment. Almost all comments on this amplifier will get unhelpful votes if there is anything bad about it. It seems that people want this to be a 5-star amplifier, but always warn, ""but it's $150. What do you expect?"" Or they'll pay ""a $150 amplifier..."" Start their rave comments. Listen, I don't just judge the equipment based on the price. I first judge the equipment based on the value and ears. The fact is, you need a very good 1x12, 2x12 or 4x12 to make micro terror sound magical. If you give up $150 for terror and spend $150-250 for a great taxi... Why Why don't you buy a great all tube 1x12 for about $300?

But as long as I like to eat British crunches for breakfast, I need a bright and clean channel and I know and love the classic punch 'n' crunch Think of solid distortion for metal and versatile players over it. Unfortunately, microterror is one trick pony in the tone category and for this (if we're starting from 5 stars) I have to cut one star. I feel confident pulling the stars for the tone. If you're in a rock band, this head is really usable, so I'll deduct another star, already owning 2x12 or 4x12 and want something small to be quick and small to use. The problem is if you are one of those people, you probably have a solid amp head to drive that 2x12 or 4x12 in the first place. This puts the microterrorism into a second state if the situation worsens or is useful as an emergency head during the gig. This leads to my last point: the intention is to buy as a bedroom practice or garage rehearsal as the head, if price is the price you can get a better product that has one good channel instead of one simple (but great). What I like about micro terror is that it's something you can always keep on your arms.

The problem is, if you are one of these people, you may already have a solid amplifier head that will drive 2x12 or 4x12 first.

After all, it's an Orange, so if you want a dirty Plexi sound with only one channel to work with... This head is for you.

Anyway, I love eating British Crunch for breakfast, I consider myself a versatile player who needs a clear and airy clean channel and that classic punch'n'crunch we all know and love and a solid deformation for metal and beyond. Unfortunately, the Micro Terror is a ONE TRICK PONY in the Tone category, and for this (if we start at five stars) I have to deduct a star. I feel confident, pulling a star for the tone because the Micro Terror does not exactly take pedals well, even without generating too much noise, which leads to the feedback. I'm pulling off another star because this head is only useful when you're in a rock band, and you already own a 2x12 or 4x12, and I want something fast and small to rock with. The problem is, if you're one of those people, you probably already have a solid amplifier head to drive that 2x12 or 4x12 in the first place. This puts the Micro Terror in secondary status or useful as an emergency head during an action when things take a turn for the worse. This leads me to my last point: if the intention is to buy this as a bedroom practice or garage rehearsal head, then for the price you can make a much better product that two GOOD channels instead of a simple (but GREAT) one. What I like about the Micro Terror is that it is something that you can always keep in your arsenal. After the Micro Terror had different combinations and headquarters experiences over the years, this niche could be filled because it can be scaled according to your performance or exercise needs. If I started over, I'd probably buy two 2x12 taxi s, a Micro Terror, and a bigger and more powerful warhead to drive both taxis if I had to. This would give you perfect flexibility for rehearsal, studio recording, small bar, large bar, club, or concert stage locations. (To those who think this research was inappropriate: I have seen this review, and almost every review of this amplifier with something bad to say is getting useless votes. It seems that people want this to be a 5-Star Amp but always with the reservation of ""but it is $150, what do you expect?"" Or they start their rave review with ""For a $150 amp..."". Look, I don't just rate the acceleration, I rate it on VALUE and with my EARS first. The reality is, you need a really nice 1x12, 2x12, or 4x12 to make the Micro Terror sound really great. If you drop a $150 for the Terror, and probably another $150$250 for a great taxi... why not? publish that $300 or so on a large ALL tube 1x12 to start with a large ALL 1x12 with two channels, better EQ, and the possibility to go from the beginning to an external cabin?)",3

When I was playing with a Les Paul, I tested it with a Marshall 1960A 4x12 and it sounds fantastic. I also tested it through my special 1x12 cabinet with a Celestion G12H30. I could find the ""sweet spot"" on the tone button, which for me was around one o'clock, and with the band at noon and the drive at max... I had entered a very musical, luxurious and absolutely Gig-worthy sound zone with which Jimi Hendrix, Angus Young and Jimmy Page would have liked to go on tour. But as much as I eat British Crunch for breakfast, I think of myself as a versatile player who needs a bright and heady channel AND this classic Punch'n'Crunch, which we all know and love AND a solid distortion for metal and beyond. Unfortunately, the microtube is a ONE TRICK PONY in the tone category, and for that (when we start with five stars) I have to subtract a star. I feel confident to subtract a star by sound, because the microcontroller also does not take pedals very well without creating too much noise, leading to feedback. I'm subtracting another star because this head is really only usable when you're in a rock band, you already have a 2x12 or 4x12, and I want something fast and small to rip out. The problem is, if you're one of these people, you probably already have a solid amplifier head to drive this 2x12 or 4x12. This brings the microcontroller to secondary status or useful as an emergency head during a gig when things turn bad. This brings me to my last point: If the intention is to buy this as a bedroom practice or garage sample head, then for the price you can get a much better product that has two GUT channels instead of a simple (but GREAT) one. WHAT I LOVE about the microcontroller is that it's something you can always keep in your arsenal. After having several different Combo amps and Head/Cabinet variants over the years, the Micro Terror was able to fill this niche as it can be scaled according to your expectations or sample needs. If I started over, I'd probably buy two 2x12 taxis, a micro terror, and a bigger and stronger pipe head to drive both taxis if necessary. This would give you perfect flexibility for band rehearsals, studio recording, small bar, large bar, club or concert stages. I have noticed this review, and almost every review from this amplifier with something bad to say about it gets unhelpful voices. It seems that people want this to be a 5-star amp, but always with the reservation ""but it's $150, what do you expect?"" or they start their rave review with ""For a $150 amp..."". Look, I judge the equipment not only by the price, but first by VALUE and with my EARS. The reality is, you need a really nice 1x12, 2x12, or 4x12 to make the Micro Terror sound really fantastic. If you drop for the terror $150, and probably another $150~$250 for a great taxi... Why not spend this $300 or so on a large ALL-Tube 1x12 to start with two channels, better EQ and the possibility to drive from the get-go to an external cabin?)",3
5962,"Orange Micro Terror is a powerful hybrid head ab capable of driving any number of speakers shoot at it. It's a low-power fail-safe pipe override and classic British tuna in your palm of your hand. Why only three stars? For starters, this is what I would consider an ""innovative-boutique booster,"" because it recreates the classic English accent sounds like a boss, But the lack of a clean room is obvious. It's an orange after all, and so if you want a dirty plaque sound with only one channel to work with, this head is for you. Playing with Les Paul, I tried it through a Marshall 1960A 4x12 and it sounds amazing. I also tried it through my own locker 1x12 loaded with a Celestion G12H30. I managed to find the ""sweet spot"" on the Tuna button, which for me was around four, and with the volume at noon and the Unit at maximum... I had entered a very musical, sensual, and highly commendable tuna zone with which Jimmy Hendrix, Angus Young and Jimmy Page would very much like to go on tour. Nevertheless, as much as I like to eat British Creams for breakfast, I consider myself a flexible player who needs a bright, bright, clean channel and this classic punch-in-the-criss that we all know and love and a steady deformation for The metal and beyond. Unfortunately, Micro Teror is a TRICK PONY in the tuna category, and for that (if we start with five stars) I have to remove a star. I feel confident that I'm removing a star from the tuna because Little Terror doesn't catch the pedals without making too much noise, which leads to a reaction. I'm removing another star because this head is only really useful if you're in a rock band, already owns a 2x12 or 4x12, And he wants something fast and small to use to rock me. The problem is, if you're one of those people, you probably already have a solid head of vinegar to drive this 2x12 or 4x12 from the start. This puts Micro Terror in a secondary situation or useful as a head of emergency during a job if things take a turn for the worse. This brings me to my last point: if you intend to buy this as a bedroom practice or for rehearsal in the garage, then for the price you could get a much better product with two good channels instead of a simple (but big) one. What I like about the little terror is that it's something you can always keep in your armory. Having in its possession several different head/cabinet enhancers and variants over the years, Micro Teror could fill this position, because it can be scaled according to the needs of the performance or rehearsal. If I started from scratch, I'd probably buy two 2x12 cabs, a Micro Terror, and a bigger and stronger pipe head to drive both cabs if I had to. That would give you perfect flexibility for band practice, studio recording, small bar, big bar, club, or concert venues. I have observed this criticism, and almost every criticism of this amplifier, with anything bad to say about it, has useless votes, It seems the world wants to be a Five Star Enforcer, but always with the warning of ""but it's 150, what do you expect?"" Or they start the review with ""For a $150 amp..."". Look, I don't just judge equipment by price, I judge it by value and mine first. The reality is, you need a really nice 1x12, 2x12, or 4x12 to actually make Micro Terror sound amazing. If you're flying $150 for terrorism, and probably another $150$250$for a big cab... Why not spend this $300 or so on a large OL-1x12 to start with a large ALL-1x12 tube with two channels, better EQ, and the choice of route to an external chamber from the starting point?)",3
5963,"In a word: Orange micro fear can drive a certain number of speakers with a powerful hybrid amplifier head. Its low wattage ensures super drive and classic British colors on your palm. Why are there only three stars? First of all, I think this is a ""magical best amplifier"". Because it reproduces the old British voice, it sounds like the boss, but there is obviously not enough clean space. Anyway, it's orange. As long as you want a dirty nerve gun with only one saint, this one is for you. When playing with lees Paul, I tested it with Marshall 1960a 4x12. It sounds good. In addition, a custom 1x12 cabinet with acceleration g12h 30 was tested. I can find the ""highest score"" in the tone switch. For me, it's about one o'clock. The volume is the highest at noon and the ride is the highest. I entered a very musical, gorgeous and completely suitable for performance. Jimmy Hendrix, Anders and Jimmy Page would love to travel with me. However, I like eating English style Krona fish in the morning, but I think I am a versatile player and need a bright and exciting clean channel. We all know that I like classical panel conversation and solid deformation of metal. Unfortunately, beauty terror is a small technique in tonal types. So (if we start with five stars) I have to reduce one star. I have confidence in reducing an asterisk in tone. Because even subtle fear can't control the pedal well and cause feedback when the noise is small. I took off another star. Because this mind is really useful only when you have 2x12 or 4x12 in a rock band and want to have fast and small rock. The problem is that if it were one of these people, it might have a solid amplifier head that can drive 2x12 or 4x12. This can put American terrorist events in a secondary position or take American terrorist events as emergency command during the performance when the situation worsens. If you want to buy a leader in bedroom practice or garage rehearsal, you can get better products at this price. Not a simple channel, but two good channels. The terrorist attacks in the United States that I like are things that can be kept in the Arsenal forever. Micro terrar has multiple combined amplifiers and head / cabinet deformations. Can fill the vacancy. Because it can be reduced according to your performance or rehearsal needs. If I start from the beginning, I can buy two 2x12 taxis, a mini horror car, and a bigger and stronger pipe to drive two taxis. It provides perfect flexibility for band rehearsal, studio recording, bar, bar, club and concert stage. (people who think this comment is not helpful: I understand this comment. If almost all the comments on this amplifier have something bad, you can get tickets that are not helpful. People want a five-star amplifier, but always say ""but $150, what do you expect?"" Or they will start their crazy comment with ""150 dollar amplifier..."". After listening to it, I judge the equipment not according to the price, but according to the value and ears. In fact, I need a good 1x12, 2x12, 4x12. If you give up $150 for fear, you will spend $150-250 for a very good taxi... Why not spend $300 first to buy a beautiful front official 1x12? There are two channels, there is a better balancer, and you can go to the external cab from the beginning?)",3

Therefore: BUY if you have the space and either need the three presets, or do not have a loop or a delay. CONSIDER PASSING, if the loop or midi functionality seriously drives your decision... both are weak, after the fact, implementations",3
6010,"First of all, it's huge. No, really huge... But you're finally getting over it, but seriously, it's huge. The three presets are what separates it, but this could be so much better... Why? The medium-time synchronization application is defective. Ahh. The timing of delay with half-time is erratic and largely unreliable, especially if you want to change the presets during a song or turn them on/off. B To have a midi in, and not be able to midi loop synchronization/quantification. Breathing. Like really? That means you can't play with drums, a sampler, a sequence or play with anyone who does! So, while this offers some functionality over the Flashback, since this unit provides three default delays (of which only one can be used simultaneously) and can be used as a base loop (together with the delay specified by the buttons) Therefore:BY if you have the space and either you need the three presets, or you do not have a loop or a delay. loop or middle operation is seriously driving your decision... both are weak, after the fact, the application",3
6011,"First of all, it's huge. It doesn't feel very huge. But you finally overcome this, but it's really huge. These three settings make this different, but this book may be better.. What's up? MIDI table is synchronous and defective. A. Delayed MIDI clock synchronization is unstable and unreliable. Especially when you want to change or turn off the settings in advance in a song. B. Although MIDI is installed, it is not possible to synchronize / quantify the whole set of equipment. Sigh, really. This means you can't play with a roller machine, a sample machine, a sound machine or anyone. Therefore, the device provides three preset delays (only one can be used at a time) and can be used as a basic plug (delay defined by the switch), so the disadvantage is that it occupies a lot of space. Therefore, if you have space or need three presets, or there is no plug or delay, please buy. If the plug-in or MIDI functionality has seriously affected your decision, consider skipping. In fact, both are weak",3

6076,"I just got these, but I think I'll make a first impression. I bought headphones because I think listening to music at work is more pleasant than listening to music in my ears. I chose this model because they are on sale and look like a rough diamond. The comments show that it fits the big head (I'm wearing an XL hat). Construction is average. They are not fragile in my hands, but you can see that the plastic parts are nothing special. The padding of the headband is a little uneven at the seams. When you open the headband and put the device on your head, it looks a little twisted. Connect the 3M long cable to the base of the left earphone. The headset can be rotated 90 degrees forward, 35 degrees backward, or 90 degrees downward. The swivel joint above the ear piece allows the ear piece to fold up into the headband. I listened to music for about 45 minutes at the beginning. I was very happy. I'm not particularly picky, but I do like a good voice. There are some good bass, classical music is very clear. The headphones did make me realize that the recording quality of several songs I tried was very low (listening to HD Music on YouTube can solve the problem I heard). I wasn't completely blown away. When they were plugged into my computer, I did hear some noise, but nothing played, even though my iPod didn't (so I'm not sure if it's due to headphones). They are comfortable, but not as comfortable as I want. I do feel someone pushing my ear. The round ear pad is not big enough to fit my whole ear. They are really warmer than I thought. I'm really relieved to take them off. I think after about an hour, they will obviously feel uncomfortable. I'm a little hesitant to wear headphones because I'm afraid of it. Unfortunately, it's really a problem. Who knows, maybe they will run in and improve. If I have more reports, I will update this comment. For now, I think they are worth the price, even if they are not a shiny rough diamond. If I could give about 3.5 stars, I would; But now, I'll give you three points. They are priced accurately and are generally typical high-quality products. Some special advantages are balanced by some disadvantages. Update 7 / 19: I've been putting headphones in a box for days, which helps. Interestingly, the adjustable part can become very large! It's comfortable on my head, about the third of the 10 size grooves... But pushing your head is the nervous part. If you adjust them bigger, they will only fall under your ears, not loosen. In addition, I compared them with Sennheiser HD201. TASCAM sounds better, but Sennheiser is more comfortable (lighter, oval earmuffs, better fit). Update 7 / 23: I think box stretching has helped. I can now wear them for about 2 hours until I find them uncomfortable. It is still a relatively short time. Update Date: August 9, 2013: the headset has been placed in a box wider than my head, and I don't use it at any time. I guess my head / ears are used to stress due to stretching, and I'm learning how to adjust them regularly to transfer stress, with a slight improvement in comfort. However, I think my rating will remain three-star. The sound is good enough to give it a few stars, and the price is low enough to buy another one. However, one month should be enough to make the mobile phone reach the standard availability, which doesn't satisfy me. Conclusion: if your head is very large, I suggest you change it (the circumference of my head is about 24 / 61 cm, or the size of American hat is 7 and 5 / 8) Clamping will definitely cause discomfort. The round ear pad doesn't work. It will keep your head warm. This is not unbearable, but if you can find a substitute, it may be the best. Nevertheless, please note that I only reduced the stars for the sake of fit!! I can't speak for someone with a slightly smaller head (and ears)... If these are suitable for many people, I think this is a 5-star product! Sounds great, strong, etc. Update 11 / 14 / 13: a friend of mine bought a pair of audio technica M50 when I bought this pair of shoes. I can try it out today and it's better for half an hour. I'm not very experienced, the sound quality is very good, but I think the M50 is definitely the winner. The most obvious difference is the increased volume, but overall, the sound is more pleasant. The bass seems to be more supported, the treble feels smoother, less static, and so on. Apart from the volume, these differences are not great. I must pay more attention to them. The purpose of this update is to say that you won't buy a $150 TASCAM headset for $30. What you get is a very good headset. Its sound should satisfy most people. I think what you pursue is a diminishing return on sound quality, not just paying more for headphones (in this case, you will pay five times more for M50... But I don't think you will get five times the sound quality). M50 is obviously more comfortable (although they do make your ears warmer), and the appearance feels better (stronger, smoother adjustment, more beautiful, etc.). Combined with all these things, you may start to consider that the price difference is reasonable.",3

Clamping will definitely cause discomfort. The round ear pad doesn't work. It will warm your head. This is not unbearable, but if you can find a substitute, it may be the best. However, please note that I just narrow the stars to adapt!! I can't speak for someone with a smaller head (and ears)... Update 11 / 14 / 13: a friend of mine bought a pair of technica M50 stereo when I bought this pair of shoes. I can try it today and try it in half an hour. I'm not very experienced and the sound quality is good, but I think the M50 is definitely the winner. The most obvious difference is the increase in volume, but in general, the sound is more pleasant. The bass sounds more durable, the treble feels smoother, less static, etc. these differences are not great outside the volume. I have to compare it carefully. The purpose of this update is just to say that you won't get a $150 Tuscan headset for $30. You have a good earphone and its sound should satisfy most people. I think you're looking for a declining sound quality performance, not just paying more headphones (in this case, you pay 5x M50... But I don't think you'll get 5x sound quality). The M50 is obviously more comfortable (although it does warm your ears) and feels better (stronger, smoother, more beautiful, etc.). All these factors together, you may begin to think that the price difference is reasonable.",3
6078,"I just received these but I thought I would give my first impression. As I bought headphones, I thought it was a more comfortable way to listen to music than work in ear types. What I chose this model seemed to be a rough diamond because they were selling and reviews showed good for a big head, I put an XL hat size. Build is average. They don't rub with my hands, but plastic parts find nothing special, wise wise. The padding for the headband is a little uneven of the seam so as to open the headband to place the unit on your head, it is a sort warp of looks. A 3 meter cable is attached to the base of the left headphone. Headphones can swivel 90 degrees behind, maybe 35 degrees back and down 90 degrees. The swivel joint on the ear portion can fold them up to the headband. I was very glad to hear about 45 minutes of music immediately. I like not only special but good sound. Some good bass, classical music was clear. Headphones let me realize I had a low quality record for some of my songs I tried (listening to equivalent HD on YouTube that solved the problem I heard). I was utterly blown away. I hear a little noise when they are connected to my computer and not playing anything, but I don't know if I can be accused of headphones, not for my iPod. They are comfortable, but I'm not comfortable as you like. I don't feel great against some of my ears, the round ear pad fits enough to my ear. They are warmer than I. I feel sure to turn them off and feel relieved. I think they are comfortable and comfortable about an hour later. I was hesitating to get over this ear headphone for fear of this and unfortunately it turned out to be a problem. Who knows, maybe they will wear and improve. I will update this review if I have more reports. For now, they say it's worth the cost, even if it's not a mad diamond. I'll give you 3 if I can give you about 3.5 stars. They are exactly the price, and overall typical quality products. Some exceptions are balanced at some disadvantages. Update July 19: I've been stretching headphones to boxes for a few days, it helped a little. Funny is that adjustable pieces become huge! About 1 / 3 of the notch of 10 size is comfortable with the head. But pressing against your head is a tight part. If you adjust them bigger they just fall under your ears. I also compared them with Sennheiser HD 201. The tascams have better sound, but Sennheiser is more comfortable (they are light, ear cups are oval and better fit). Update July 23: I think the box stretch is supported, I can wear them for about 2 hours now before they realize they become uncomfortable. Still relatively short time. Update 8 / 9 / 2013: headphones live in a wider box than my head at any time they are not used. Comfort is slightly improved and I have guessed for stretch out, get used to my head / ear pressure and learn how to adjust the pressure to shift regularly. But I think my assessment will remain at 3 stars. The sound is good enough to give it a couple stars and a low enough price for another. But the moon should be long enough for the phone to penetrate into standard usable degrees. Conclusion: if you have exceptionally large heads, I recommend finding another pair, note that I only reduced the stars for seizures! I picked up a pair of audio technica M50 around the same time I bought this pair, I could try them, and the quality of the sounds I had experienced very much, but I felt that m50s was definitely a winner. The most obvious difference was the added volume, but the sound has generally delighted my ears. I think you are pursuing to reduce the profits by sound quality alone to pay more for this headphone (in this case you will pay 5x more for m50s, but I don't think you're getting 5x sound quality) the m50s is more comfortable (they will warm your ears) and the build is better (feel stronger, smooth adjustments, clean things, etc.) all these combinations may begin to reasonably consider the price difference.",3
6079,"I just got it, but I think I'll give you a first impression. I bought headphones because it's easier to listen to music at work than to music in my ears. I chose this model because they made a discount that looked like rough diamonds, and the comments showed that it was suitable for a big head (I wore an XL hat). Building average. They are not fragile in my hands, but you see, there is nothing special about plastic parts. The padding on the head is a little uneven at the seams. When you open the scarf and put the device on your head, it looks a little crooked. Connect a 3M long cable to the base of the left earphone. The headset can be rotated 90 degrees forward, 35 degrees backward and 90 degrees downward. The swivel joint above the ear curls the ear up and down into a bandage. I listened to music for about 45 minutes from the beginning and was very happy. I'm not very picky, but I really like a good voice. There are some good bass, classical music is very clear. The headphones did make me realize that the recording quality of several songs I tried was very low (listening to high-end music on YouTube can solve the problem I hear) . I wasn't blown up either. I heard some noise when they plugged into my computer, but I didn't lose anything, even though it wasn't (so I'm not sure if I can attribute it to headphones) . they are very comfortable, but not as comfortable as I thought. I really feel someone pushing my ears. The round cushion on my ears is not big enough to plug all my ears. They are moving Take them off, I feel much better. I think they will feel bad in about an hour. I hesitate to put on my headphones because I'm afraid of it, and at night Alenia, this is really a problem. Who knows, maybe they will make things smoother and better. If I have more reports, I will update this sentence. If I could give you about 3.5 stars, I would; but now I will give you 3 points. The price is accurate. Generally speaking, it is typically high Excellent quality. Some special advantages are offset by some disadvantages. Update 7 / 19: I've put the headphones in the box for several days, which is a little helpful. Interestingly The adjustable part may become big! It's very comfortable on my head, about slot 10 3... But pushing it on your head is part of the pressure. In addition, I compared it with HD201 senhazel. TASCAM sounds better, but senheiser is more comfortable (lighter, oval headset, more suitable) Update 7:23: I think stretching the box has helped. Now I can put it on in about 2 hours until I find that they become uncomfortable. It's still a short time. The headphones are wider than my head in the box and have never been used. I think my head / ears are used to pressure by stretching. I'm studying how to adjust them regularly, Thursday Obi moves the pressure and slightly improves his comfort. However, I think my ranking will remain three-star. The sound is good enough to give him a few stars, and the price is also DOS However, one month should be enough to make the mobile phone reach the standard availability level, which is inappropriate for me. The head is very big. I suggest you change it (the circumference of my head is about 24 / 61 cm, or the size of American hat is 7 and 5 / 8) The clip is bound to cause discomfort, the round cushion on your ears doesn't work, and it will keep your head warm. It's not unbearable, but if you find a substitute, it may be the best. However, please note that I just want to adapt and shrink the stars! If it suits many people, I think it is a five-star product! It sounds great and strong The timbre is good, but I think the M50 is the absolute winner. The most obvious difference is the increase in volume, but in general, the sound is more pleasant. Pay attention to them. The purpose of this update is to tell you that you do not purchase TASCAM headphones. The price of $150 is $30. You have a very good headset, and his voice should be satisfied by most people. I think you are pursuing the return of sound quality, not just the cost of m-50 Gore headphones ZDO is more comfortable (although they will make the ears warmer), the appearance is better (better, smoother, more beautiful, etc.) all these factors together, you can begin to think that the price difference is reasonable.",3
6080,"I just got this, but I thought I'd make my first impression. I bought headphones because I thought it was a more pleasant way to listen to music at work than in-ear type. I chose this model because they were for sale, looked like a diamond in the rough, and reviews indicated a that it would be good for big heads (I wear an XL hat size). The construction is average. They don't feel weak in my hands, but you can see that the plastic parts are nothing special, very wise. The filling for the headband is a little uneven on the seam, when you open the headband to put the unit on your head, it seems a little distorted. The 3-meter cable is attached to the bottom of the left main phone. The main phones can both turn 90 degrees forward, maybe 35 degrees back, and 90 degrees down. The spine above the earrings allows them to fold up in the main band. I immediately listened to about 45 minutes of music and was very happy. I'm not special, but I like a good sound. There's a good bass, classical music was clear. The headphones made me realize that I had low quality recordings for some of my songs that I tried to try out (listening to the HD equivalent on YouTube made problems that I heard solved). I wasn't blown away, either. I do hear a little noise when they are in my computer and play nothing, but not for my iPod (so I do not know if this can be attributed to the headphones). They're comfortable, but not as comfortable as I'd like them to be. I feel something pushing against my ears, the round ear cushions aren't big enough to fit my whole ear. They're getting warmer than I'd like. I'm relieved to have them out. I think after about an hour, they're clearly uncomfortable. I was a little reluctant to get over-ear headphones in fear of this, and unfortunately it turned out to be a problem. Who knows, maybe they'll enlist and improve them. I will update this assessment when I have more to report. For now, I'd say they're worth the price, even if they're not a diamond in the rough. If I could give about 3.5 stars, I would; But for now, I'll give you three. They are accurately priced, and generally a typical quality product. Some extraordinary benefits are weighed against some. Update 7/19:I've been stretching the headphone on a box for a few days, it's helped a bit. The funny thing is, the adjustable part can be huge! It's comfortable on my head on about the third of the 10-format indentations... But pushing against your head is the hard part. If you adjust them bigger, they just fall under your ears instead of coming off. I also compared them to the Sennheiser HD201. The TASCAMs have a better sound, but the Sennheiser is more comfortable (they are lighter and the earrings are oval shaped and fit better). Update 7/23:I think the box stretching has helped, I can now wear them for about two hours before I notice that they are becoming uncomfortable. Still a relatively short time. Update 8/9/2013:The main phones live on a box just bigger than my head when they are not in use. The comfort is marginally better, I think by stretching, my head/ears get used to the pressure, and I learn ways to adjust them periodically to shift the pressure. However, I think my appreciation will remain on three stars. The sound is good enough to give it a few stars, and the price low enough for a lake. However, a month should be long enough for the phones to break in to a standard usable degree, and that has not happened to my satisfaction. CONCLUSION: I suggest you find another pair if you have an exceptionally large head (mine is around 24""/61cm, or US hat size 7 and 5/8) The clamping certainly leads to the discomfort, the round earrings do not quite do the trick, and it makes your head quite warm. It is not unbearable, but if you can find an alternative it is probably best. Having said that, note that I only reduced the stars for the fitting!! I cannot speak for someone with a little k Liner head (and ears?). If these fit comfortably, what I think they are for many people, they are a 5-star product! Large sounding, built solid enough, etc. Update 11/14/13:A friend of mine picked up a few Audio-Technica M50s around the same time I bought this pair, and I was able to try them out and compare them for a good half hour today. I am not very experienced w With the sound quality, but I felt that the M50s were definitely the winner. The most obvious difference was the added volume, but generally the sound was more pleasant for my ears. The bass seemed more supported, higher notes felt more flexible and less static-like, etc. The point of this update is simply to say that you will not get $150 headphones for $30 with the TASCAMS. You will get very good headphones, the sound of which should satisfy more than most people. I think you strive to reduce the noise Quality only to pay much more than this for headphones. (in this case, you would pay 5X more for the M50s...but I don't think you will get 5X the sound quality). The M50s are considerably more comfortable (although they make your ears warmer), and the construction feels better (stronger, more flexible adaptations, more beautiful, etc.) All these things combined, and you can start to find the price difference reasonable.",3

They are not weak in my hand, but you can see that there is nothing special about plastic parts. The pad joint of the hair belt is uneven.

It's comfortable on my head. It's about the third in a Gobang group of 10 sizes. But your head movement is the nervous part. If you adjust them bigger, they will only fall under your ears and won't let go. In addition, I compared them with Sennheiser HD 201.

Update Date: August 9, 2013: the headset is placed in a box wider than my head and is not used at any time. Because of stretching, I am familiar with the pressure of head / ears.

The purpose of this update is not to buy $150 TASCAM headphones for $30. What you get is a good headset. Can satisfy most people.

But I don't think you can get five times the sound quality.

6148,"I received these TASCAM headphones as part of the Amazon grapevine review program. I am very excited to receive them because I have seen them many times and consider ordering them because their price and ""professional grade"" name are reasonable. I'm not a sound enthusiast, and I'm not a snob about sound equipment. I'll buy any brand with the right price. Having said that, I've been lucky to try many headphones recently. Bose ae2w Bluetooth headphones are the latest. Obviously, Bose beat TASCAM, so it's unfair to compare them. Instead of saying ""from the perspective of sound"", you can really distinguish the difference between medium and high-grade. These TASCAM th-2000-r ""professional"" headphones don't sound clear in the medium and high frequency band.

After all, if you are a pickup, your guitar can turn on energy, and you will like these strings. If you are really interested in the primary color of sound and your guitar is not a first-class tone from the beginning, you can get a ""chance to play"", but you are likely to You will experience a slight tone drop.",3
6216,"I have a lot of friends who play on these ropes. Some love them more than any other string, and some are like me. They're clearly good strings, and I love the way they play and feel on my fingertips, but I can't get past the sound. It could be about how the strings sound on my specific guitars, but in any case I am not happy with the sound and therefore I have difficulty giving them a solid five-star rating. I tried these on two different guitars that I play regularly, and I wasn't very impressed by the sound either. One is a vintage Dreadnought mahogany guitar that normally has an excellent tone, and is crisp, clear and quite loud. These ropes softened the tone, which I didn't want to do. They sound good, but not as good as the Martin SPs I use to get the best out of that guitar. I also have a cutaway electric/acoustic voice with which I sing because it is quite quiet, and the softer tones do not displace my voice. These strings made the guitar even quieter, and there was a considerable drop-off in tone quality as well. They may have been cheap, old strings, because I couldn't say there was anything special about them. This guitar had no spectacular sound to begin with, and these strings did nothing to improve it. I like strings to sound as good as other strings, or to improve the tone and pull more from the guitar. These strings did nothing for me. But they sound great when the instrument is connected by an amplifier. Based on my experiments, I would think that if you have a great sounding guitar and you're not fond of small drops in tonal quality, you'll love the way these strings feel and play. I think they're excellent in that category. But for me, the tone is 80% of the equation. I'd play the string if it sounded better than regular strings. In the tonal category these strings fell short. On a guitar with an excellent tone, I noticed a clear drop in tone quality, and on another softer, muted guitar, tone quality disappeared. If you're a picker and you can connect your guitar, you're gonna love these strings. If you really like acoustic tone and your guitar doesn't have stellar tone to begin with, you might get some playability, but you'll probably experience a small drop in tonal quality.",3
6217,"I have many friends who play these strings. Some love them more than any other string, and some like me. They're clearly good strings, and I love the way they play and feel on my fingertips, but I can't get over the sound. It could only be about how the strings sound on my respective guitars, but in any case I am not satisfied with the sound and therefore I find it difficult to give them a solid five-star rating. I tried these on two different guitars, which I play regularly, and was also not very impressed by the sound. One is an old Dreadnought mahogany guitar, which normally has excellent sound, and is crisp, clear and quite loud. These strings softened the tone, which I didn't want. They sound okay, but not nearly as good as the Martin SPs I use to really bring out the best in this guitar. I also have a cutaway electric/acoustic that I sing with because it is quite quiet and the softer tones do not cover my voice. These strings made the guitar even quieter and there was also a significant decrease in the quality of the sound. They were perhaps cheap, old threads because I could not say that there was something special about them. This guitar had no spectacular sound at first, and these strings could not improve it. I like strings that so und as good as other strings, or improve the sound and pull more from the guitar. These strings didn't do anything for me. However, they sound good if the instrument was connected by an amplifier. Based on my experiments, I would assume that if you have a great guitar and are not a fanatic when it comes to light pitch, you will love the way these strings feel and play. I appreciate them very much in this category. But for me, sound 80% is the equation. I'd play wired rope if it sounded better than normal strings. In the sound category these strings were short. On a guitar with excellent sound, I noticed a marked decline in sound quality, and on another softer, more muffled guitar the sound quality disappeared. In the last analysis, if you are a picker and your guitar can be connected, you will love these strings. If you are really in a big acoustic tone and your guitar does not have a stellar sound at the beginning, you could gain a little ""playability"", but you will most likely experience a slight decrease in sound quality.",3

They're clearly good strings, and I like the way they play and feel on my fingers, but I can't get over the sound. It may only have to do with how the strings sound on my particular guitar, but either way, I'm not happy with the sound and that's why I'm having a hard time giving them a solid five-star rating. I tried these on two different guitars I play regularly, and I wasn't impressed by the sound. One is a classic mahogany guitar that usually has an excellent tone, and it's crisp, clean and strong enough. Those strings softened the tone, which I didn't want to do. They sound okay, but not as good as the Martin SP I used to show off the best on this guitar. I also have an electric/headset with which I sing because it is quite quiet, and the softer tones do not drown my voice. These strings made the guitar even quieter, and there was a significant drop in the quality of tuna. Maybe they were cheap, old strings, because I couldn't say there was anything special about them. This particular guitar had no spectacular sound from the start, and these strings did nothing to improve it. I like strings either to sound as good as other strings, or to improve the tone and pull more than the guitar. Those strings didn't do anything for me. However, they do sound wonderful when the organ was connected via a vineyard. Based on my experimentation, I guess if you have a great loud guitar and you're not a fan of the little drops of Tonal quality, You're gonna love the way these strings feel and play. I consider them exceptional in that category. But for me, the tone is 80% of the equation. I'd play rope wrapped in wire if it sounded better than normal strings. In the Tonal category, these strings couldn't hold. In a guitar with an excellent tone, I noticed a distinct drop in the quality of the tuna, and in another softer, more dull guitar, quality of tuna disappeared. After all, if you're a collector and your guitar can be connected, you're gonna love these strings. If you really like good acoustic tone and your guitar doesn't have star tone from the start, you might get some ""ability to play,"" But you'll probably experience a slight drop in tone quality.",3
6219,"I have many friends playing these strings. Some people like them more than any county, and some people like me. They are clearly good strings. I like the way they play on my fingertips, but I can't hear them through sound. It may just be about the sound of my guitar strings, but anyway, I'm not satisfied with its sound. That's why I can't give them a stable five-star rating. I've tried this on two different guitars. I often play, but I'm not very satisfied with the sound of these two guitars. One is the classical fearless peach blossom heart guitar. Generally, the timbre is very good, crisp and loud. These strings soften the tone. This is what I don't want to do. They sound good, but they are far from the Martin SPS I play my guitar at its best. I also have intermittent Electronics / acoustics. I sing because it is quite quiet and the soft tone will not drown my voice. These strings make the guitar quieter and the sound quality is quite poor. They may be cheap old strings. Because I don't know what's special about them. This special guitar didn't make an amazing sound at first, but these counties didn't improve it. I like the sound quality of the strings as good as other strings, or improve the timbre and get more from the guitar. These counties are useless to me. But when the machine is plugged in through the amplifier, they sound very good. According to my experiment, if you have a good guitar and don't like the sound quality, you will like the feeling and playing way of these strings. I think they are excellent in this regard. But for me, the tone is 80% of the equation. If the wire rope sounds better than ordinary wire rope, I will hit it. In terms of construction, these counties are not enough. In the guitar with good sound quality, I found that the sound quality decreased significantly, and the sound quality disappeared in another softer and quieter guitar. Finally, if you are a pickup, you can plug the power into the guitar. You will like these counties. If you are really interested in the original timbre, the guitar has no first-class timbre from the beginning. You may get some ""easy to play"", but you may also experience a slight decline in sound quality.",3
