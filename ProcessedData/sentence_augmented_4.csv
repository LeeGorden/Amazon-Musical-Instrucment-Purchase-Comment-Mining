2,"This fender cable is the perfect length for me! Sometimes I find it a little too long but it does not bother me. The quality of construction is great and I know it will last. The only grapet I have with this cable is that the metal sleeve is avoided too easily, requires me to tighten them often. The quality of the environment is not affected, and the color is cool, certainly try this cable. ",4

4,"This is a cool cheap cable that works well. I folded one of the connectors very badly but it was my fault. One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in a while. You will be able to hear them rattle. It seems that the ""retro"" look is screwing connectors on a black rubber, but other than it, the cable looks cool and works well. I also have the shorter red cable that goes perfectly with one of my guitars. I bought these theses to use while practicing with other people who use black cables. It is easier to connect to different amps without cutting someone by accident. The green cable is good for that. ",4

This is something that none of us in the diffusion field of production does not want to worry from our equipment that becomes pretty beat.second, the adapter has only one cable of a foot length . This is quite short and may not reach wherever the MIC input jack is on your camera. This means that you would need another XLR XLR micro cable to extend from the microphone to this adapter.

Second, the adapter only has a single foot in cable on it. This is quite short and may not reach where the microphone input connection is on your camera.

The sound quality is excellent. The volume only seems bny limited what the Pyle Pro will spend. I would not hesitate to use this for larger rooms with a full band and dad. I have not heard a hint of feedback and the power switch is a plus. The price of 36.99 may seem good to be true, but think of the things we pay less than we used to be. I bought a 32 & # 34; Toshiba flat screen for around $ 230, consider what that even five years ago or less would cost. The same applies to many audio equipment. Many companies bring Elctronics and music from high quality to the market, but it is great to have a company such as shure something so good and so affordable. They have always made a high-quality product and now they have one that can afford almost everyone. I can't recommend it strong enough. ",4

92,"It is so difficult to get an honest exam from all Mike who is not a SM58 shure. This is considered the golden standard through which all the others are measured. Of course, at least a part of this reputation is deserved, but perhaps more for the sustainability of SM58 than its sound. I have some SM58 and some pg58s. I had considered the SM48, but the PG58 has slightly better and almost identical specifications. The first thing I noticed out of the box was that the PG58 is slightly larger and slightly heavier. It also has a switch different from that of the SM58. Metal screens protecting them are not interchangeable. I then connected a microphone cable so that the settings are the same. I tried both mikes, one after the other, first speaking, then with singing and playing the guitar, then I changed the parameters, or more precisely, the effects and equation of PA. I repeated the experience, speaking and then sings by changing between Mikes.ure what I noticed: the SM58 is slightly flatter in the mid-term. The PG58 is slightly brighter and has a touch of presence. They are about equal on the volume. The slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an equalization or ordinary tone controls. Neither has been sensitive to many popular comments or vocal. I did not try this part on the side to a live situation or even in practice because it takes too much time and interferes with playing. It is difficult to judge in these situations too, or at least clumsy, but I used a combination of the two in practice and nobody seems to be able to say the difference, except a person actually expressed a preference for the PG58, but that could be Just the parameters. I watched the specifications for both mikes side by side. The SM58 is a little flatter in response, especially at the high end, more than 10k Hz, and it picks up a few dB before the PG 58, somewhere between 50 and 60 Hz. However, since the range Human vocal is usually between about 300 and 3000 Hz, none of these people seems likely to have a lot of effect, although the SM58 is a more reactive tad for a bass singer. I also tried two other Behringer Mikes and a Radio Shack Mike. The Behringer 8500 was totally overclassed by the two shures, ringing thin and thin and with little presence or volume. I tried a Behringer 2000xm and I was impressed by the similarity. These mkes sound almost identical (the B 2000 and the shure SM). The Behringer 2000XM seems to have been interrupted, however, and replaced by the 1800xm, a lower mike offered in packets of three for less than $ 50. I then connected a radio cabin which was a replacement backup, not removed. For practice. The model number is 33-3001, probably also interrupted. It was an excellent Mike poll, with a good volume, a presence and a tone. I did not have other minutes to test this way using a lateral experience, but I reached some conclusions: there is some snobbery in the choice of microphones, with the shure SM58 retained as an inaccessible standard. They are strong and they are good minutes and the price is not unreasonable, at about $ 100. However, there are other microphones that sound almost identical and are also robust and reliable at lower prices, including the PG58 shure, and probably the SM48, although I had none of those to test. I hope more people would give impartial reviews based on real performances instead of condescension towards those who are either on a budget or looking for standard bearer alternatives. I give this 4 stars because because I did not have enough time to give an assessment of how this is compared to the SM58. ",4
93,"It is so hard to get a fair revision of a mike that is no Shure SM58. This is considered the gold standard with which all others are measured. Of course at least a part of this reputation has earned, but perhaps more to the sustainability of the SM58 than the sound. I have a few SM58s and a few PG58s. I considered the SM48, but the PG58 has slightly better specs, and almost identical price. The first thing that I saw from the box was that the PG58 is slightly larger and slightly heavier.

I repeated the experiment, speaking and then singing while changing between mikes. There I have noticed: the SM58 is slightly flat in the middle range. The PG58 is slightly clearer and has more presence. They are approximately equal to volume. The small differences in tone can easily be manipulated with an EQ or just ordinary tone arrangements. Nor was susceptible to a lot of feedback or vocal doll. I have not tried this side in a live situation or even in practice, because it is too time-consuming and interferes with playing. It is difficult to judge those situations, or at least uncomfortable, but I have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference, except that one person actually has a preference for the PG58, but That can only be the settings. I looked at the specifications for the two Mikes next to each other. The SM58 is a bit flatter in response, especially at the high end, more than 10k Hz, and it absorbs a few dB for the PG 58, somewhere between 50 and 60 Hz. However, because the human vocal range is generally between about 300 and 3000 Hz, none of these probably seems to have a lot of effect, although the SM58 may react a bit to a bass singer. I also have two different Behringer Mikes and a radio shack mike. The Behringer 8500 was completely specialized by both shures, sounding looks and thin and with little presence or volume. I tried a Behringer 2000xM and was impressed by the parable. These mikes sound almost identical (the B 2000 and the Shure SM). However, the Behringer 2000XM seems to be stopped and replaced by the 1800XM, an Inferior Mike offered in bundles of three for less than $ 50.I then connected to a radio shack Mike that was a backup backup, not even for practice. The model number is 33-3001, probably also terminated. This was an excellent sounding Mike, with a good volume, presence and tone. I had no other mikes to test experiment in this side, but I have reached a number of conclusions: there is quite a few snoby in choosing microphones, with the Shure SM58 ceased as any unreachable standard. They are firm and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable, at around $ 100. However, there are other microphones that sound almost identical and are also firm and reliable, at lower prices, including the Shure PG58, and probably the SM48, Although I had none of that to test. I wish more people would want rude reviews based on actual performance instead of condensing towards those who are on a budget or are looking for alternatives to the standard carrier. I just give these 4 stars because I have not had enough time to give an evaluation of how this means compared to SM58. ",4

I would probably be too ready to agree with those who argue that a Micro Neumann or Telefunken costing 5 g is simply not as better as a micro nady costing 10 dollars. But with regard to the shre, I am less sure that the SM58 was not worth 40% more than the PG58. Maybe if you have a sufficiently powered and ""clean"" amplifier and you have changed the EQ settings to promote the frequencies of the human voice, the two microphones can be confused one for the others. It was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency P.A. This led me to realize that the PG58 sounded somewhat deaf and dull compared to the SM58. Go to the more common microphone, certainly more expensive, gave me just the extra gain I needed with a crisis and clarity added to the voice (at least for ads) .p.s.

100,"Whereas the SM57 was introduced worldwide in 1967, one year after the SHURE SM58LC SHURE SM58LC vocal microphone, I guess the 58 observes Batman's status, relegating the 57 to that of Robin. But it is not really a just evaluation that the 57 and 58 have been developed at the same time, and with the exception of the 58 acoustic foam cage pop screen, the two micro are electrically identical. SM (studio microphone) 57 has been designed to start living in a recording studio, as a dynamic microphone used to microcumper the growing volume of rock and roller amplifiers, battery kits, etc. As such, he had no use for the pop screen of his cousin the SM58, always one of the world's most sold voice microphones to date. So, the SM57 has been cleared and even if it is always a fine vocal micro, you will see it mainly of micro-micro instruments, that it excels its time and that the most important roles.

108,"The first microphone rule is that ""no microphone is perfect for all purposes."" The two rule is: ""Experiment with different microphones in different applications to find your signature sound"". I used Shure SM58 with their ancestors and their parents back to 1968. I mainly used them for the broadcast and recording of spoken words, but I used (and I still used ) To sing backup voices. The SM58 does one thing well and it's a voice performance when it is used very close to the mouth for the use of the public address. Some people, including me, actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance framework when using another microphone, the SM-57 shure. The SM-58 is a very good voice vocal and for some people probably the best choice. For example, anyone who can not withstand the setting up of the microphone on their lips while will probably sing the SM-58. People with sweetest or lower voices will want the SM-58.LE SM-58 is highly directional and has a significant but manageable proximity effect (which means that the bass increases the closest you get.) This Micro does not pick up much more 8 inches away. The reason so many singers think that you are supposed to push microphones practically inside your mouth, it's because the bullet-type bullet voice microphones require that you get them very close or do not sound well . On the other hand, the SM-57 sounds several inches from the user's mouth and works well up to 12 inches. While the SM-58 is certainly the professional microphone PA professional number one, there are few other uses because it has a colorful sound with an increase in the important frequency response in the upper slime of Mitge plus a sound source must be very close before it is picked up clearly. It works well for Conga Drums etc., but the SM-58 is pretty much the last thing you would like to use for Micro Saxo or a guitar. Personally, these pickups are not the best for my microphone technique or fundamental nature my voice, but for some people, they sound great. The live voice microphone that works better for me is the SM-57 shure with a windshield. However, for other people, the SM-58 works better. It depends on your voice and what you want the microphone to do. If you have a very deep voice, the SM-58 could be the second best choice after the SM-57 that has a better response to low frequency.On a certain advantage of the SM-58 is the excellent gain before feedback capacity . This microphone can be returned stronger than almost any other microphone without this boring apple. Another advantage of the SM-58 is that it is still available (at a slight additional cost) with an integrated on / off switch. The SM-58 ball-shaped grillings are very robust and even if you should tooth, you can get a replacement over about ten dollars. I saw SM-58 of SM-58, rusty, dusty, smoky, spit in, with missing pieces and slammed in a step of the hardwood with the total weight of a boom support adding a mass to the fall and Yet I have never seen but a stop working and this malfunction was due to an ON / OFF switch that was dirt. The Pro Line shures are also derived from their value. If you buy one and decide that you do not like that, you can get what you paid for this on eBay. I would compare as many microphones as possible before buying one. Evolution of Senneheiser The pickups are really good too and are worth a glance. The SM-58 will be the number one microphone on a predictable future, because most people follow the crowd instead of trying different pickups and choosing the one that works better for their particular voice. These things are so durable that even if they have stopped doing them today, they would always be there for at least 20 years. ",4
109,"The first line of microphones is that, ""nobody microphone is perfect for every purpose."" Rule two is, ""experiment with different microphones in different applications to find your characteristic noise."" I have used Shure SM58s, together with their ancestors and family members back to 1968. I mainly used them to broadcast and record spoken word content, but I have used them (and still use them) to back up vocals to sing. The SM58 does one thing, which is vocal performance when they are used very close to the mouth for use at the public address. Some people, I have supplied, actually better and more comfortable in a live implementation setting when using another microphone, the Shure SM-57. The SM-58 is a very good vocal microphone and probably the best choice for some people. This way anyone who cannot resist the microphone against their lips, while singing probably will like the SM-58. People with softer or weaker voices will want the SM-58.The SM-58 is very directed and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect (which means that the bass gets closer to you.) This microphone does not take much.) 8 centimeters away. The reason that so many singers think that you have to push microphones practically in your mouth is because the ball type Shure Vocal MICS needs you to get them very close or they don't sound good. On the other hand, the SM-57 sounds the best number of centimeters of the user's mouth and works great up to 12 centimeters away. Although the SM-58 is certainly the number one professional PA vocal mic, there are a few other other applications because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source it must be very close to it is clearly picked up. It works well for Conga drums and the like, but the SM-58 is about the last thing you would like to use to make a Sax or guitar. Personally these microphones are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice, but for some people they sound great. The live vocal microphone that works best is the Shure SM-57 with a windscreen. However, the SM-58 works better for other people. It depends on your voice and what you want the microphone. If you have a very deep voice, the SM-58 can be the second best choice after the SM-57 that has a better low frequency response. A certain advantage of SM-58 is the excellent profit for feedback options. This microphone can be blown louder than almost any other microphone without those irritating PA squeak. Another advantage of the SM-58 is that it is still available (at a small extra cost) with a built-in / off switch. The bellular grills of the SM-58 are very sturdy and even if you have to dent one, you can get a replacement with which around ten dollars screws. I have seen SM-58s, rusty, dusty, smoked, spits to, with pieces lacking and struck in a hardwood phase with the full weight of a boom standard that adds mass to the fall with work and those faults were the result of An on / off switch that Dirtin has in IT. All the Pro-Line Shure MICS are top quality. The pro-line shures also keeps their value good. If you buy one and you don't like it, you can come about what you have paid for ebay. I would compare as many MICS as possible before I buy one. Senneheiser's Evolution MICS Sound really good and are worth a look. The SM-58 is the number one on the stage vocal microphone for the near future because most people follow the crowd instead of trying another mics and choose the one who works best for their specific voice. These things are so sustainable, even if they stopped them, they would still be another 20 years today. ",4

One of the first microphones we really fell in love with the SM58. Introduced by Shure Brothers in 1966, the SM58 quickly increased to becoming the industrial standard in robust micro-pilots that sound in the ear and are almost indestructible. The micro capsule is cardiord design (in the form of a heart) that helps to reject its sound on each side. There is a 4K bump in its frequency that helps the voices cut through the sound of the scene.

150,"I am currently using two types of Capos - Kyser One and Capos Shubb. The two are the most popular capos around, but have different strengths and weaknesses. The benefits of the cyst are that it is the fastest changing capo that I encountered, does not require a voltage adjustment. And can clip until the end of the pusher when out of service. The main advantage of ShUBB is that it has an adjustable tension (and a second, it is smaller). The main disadvantage of Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension. Because it is designed to work through the cuff, it will apply more force than needed to hang the lower frets, which requires frets to wear faster over time. For this reason, I prefer to use the Kyyer on my cheaper guitar and the pubes of the guitar that I am baby. ",4

The primary advantage of the SHABB is that the adjustable voltage has (and second, it is smaller). The most important disadvantage of the kyser is the lack of adjustable voltage.

197,"A friend came up with our monthly guitar club meeting with this and I loved to have a on / off switch on my fingertips. Genius! I immediately bought 2. The shorter goes from my guitar to the pedal board and the longer from the pedal board to the amplifier. Works as a charm and no excuse now for harmful amplifiers or ears. Two problems to consider. The right corner stop was a mm or 2 briefly able to stay in my tele and my Takamine. It would not be good and would fly out. I had to turn the cord and use the right corner on the pedal board side, where it worked, but now the switch and # 34; down and # 34;. I don't think Planet waves the first connector is where I had a problem with, so I don't give them the blame, but may be at the straight connection if you are not sure. Second issue is simply that these small knot switches are more picky. You have to make sure you have it in the right position by looking at them - don't feel.

200,"I really like the product. For me, the only problem is the moment of ""the lasting effect"". It's not so long since I thought. I think it would be like the piano burner. But it's a good pedal effect. My guitar receives a good sound with the attack effect. Thank you. ",4
201,"I love the product a lot. For me the only problem is the time of the ""Sustainer effect"". It's not as long as I thought. I would be it as the sustainer of the piano. But it is a good pedal effect. My guitar gets a good sound with the ""attack effect"". Thank you. ",4
202,"As many of the previous posters have been cleverly mentioned, ""you will need a noise door to use this pedal"". I totally agree with that. And that will bear your notes. It will increase the volume to make them suffer. But you will have a foreign whistling when the guitar does not play to cover it. The only way to get rid of this whistle is to use a noise door. I use the NS-2 when I use my pedal chain. That said, these pedals have wonderful uses. Each note will have the same volume. You can hit the chord as strong as you want or so gently and will play at the same volume. You can define it to support for days. Once again, you will need a noise door. There is nothing transparent about this compressor because there are almost all my other compressors, but none of them are also ""active"" as it is. This is perhaps the price you pay for this pedal can do. I recommend playing with that long enough. You can make incredible funk, jazz, vibrate of metal. ",4
203,"Since several of the previous posters called Attuuty, ""you need a noise hotel to use this pedal."" I totally agree with that. And it will support your notes. It will actually increase the volume to lower them. But you will be strange when the guitar does not play to cover it. The only way to get rid of this SIS is to use a rudder port. I use the NS-2 when I use my pedals chain. That said, these pedals have a number of wonderful applications. Every note has the same volume. You can get the chord as hard as you want or so soft and it will play on the same volume. You can set to support days. Again, you need a sound gate. There is nothing transparent about this compressor because there are almost all my other compressors, but none of them is like ""active"" as this.

204,"The CS3 boss is just for me, I use it with great results, I have many compressors, line6, mxr, behringer, digitech, and although I alternate their use, the boss stands out from many flat configurations -formation, it can feel a little overcomes sometimes but usually a very good product, I have strongly recommended it as your main compressor, if you do not like that, you probably do not know how to configure it, good luck.

",4
206,"It really hurts me to give anything, but a 5-star critic at a boss product because I am a big fan of their range of products and create a global quality. These compliments apply equally to the CS-3 compression trader. And that does work in a reasonable way without you having to worry about putting a less reliable brand in my signal chain.However, there are some minor problems with this pedal you need to know. The two most common complaints I see are that he adds ""noise"" to your amp and change the tone a little. The old complaint is probably true, although you are enough of an amateur to use a compression, you are probably already considered to use a noise / suppressor door, such as the boss NS-2. Problem resolved.Ausi for this last complaint (changes tone), it is also true, but it is not necessarily a bad thing if you like the resulting tone. The entire point of the CS-3 is that it is supposed to cut the extremes of your tone and maintain it. This can cause a muddy tone, ""sterilized"", although you can play with the tone and other settings to help it. I also find that with the parameters at 12 o'clock, the output is too quiet compared to other pedals during the default settings.Ellly, while the boss pedals are considered ""dear"" compared to many others effects, the CS-3 should really be considered a ""budget"" compressor or ""input level"", when you consider that most quality compressors are either in rack units or as a Keeley compressor cost north $ 200. The best thing to say about the boss (even compared to the MXR options at a similar price) is that the CS-3 gives you a lot of control over your compression for a reasonable price. The biggest negative of the pedal, in my opinion, is that the resulting sound may seem a bit too ... tablet. But there are a lot of things you could do with a CS-3, and it works better with d Other pedals (Chorus, delay, some distortions) that you try to smooth. In the end, it was a pedal that could have been better, although there are not too much significant responses until you are north of $ 100 anyway. ",4
207,"It really hurts me to give something other than a 5-star review to a Bait Product, because I am such a big fan of their product line and generally builds quality. These compliments apply equally to the CS-3 compression Sustainer. And it does the work reasonably well without worrying about making a less reliable brand in my signal chain. There are also some minor problems with this pedal that you need to know. The two most common complaints that I see are that the ""noise"" adds to your amplifier and that it changes the tone a bit. The former complaint is probably true, although if you are enough of a hobbyist to use a compression rental person, you are probably already considered using a rumity / suppressor, such as the boss NS-2. Problem solved.As for the last complaint (changes tone), that's true, but it is not necessarily a bad thing if you keep the tone of the tone that results. The entire point of the CS-3 is that it is supposed to disable and support the extremes of your tone. This can result in a muddy, ""castrated"" tone, although you can play with the tone and other settings to help it. I also think that with the settings at noon, the output is too quiet compared to other pedals with default settings. Really, while Boss pedals are considered 'duration' compared to many of the other effects that are CS-3 should really be viewed as a ""budget"" or ""access level"" compressor, when you believe that most Quality compressors in rack units are or something like a Keeley compressor to the north of $ 200. The best thing you can say about the boss (even compared to the MXR options priced in the same way) is that the CS-3 gives you a lot of control over your compression for a reasonable price. In my opinion, the biggest negative of the pedal is that the resulting sound may seem like a little ... Compressed. But there are many things that you could do with a CS-3, and it works best combined with other pedals (Chorus, Delay, some distortions) that you try to smooth out. Ultimately it is a pedal that could have been better, although not too much considerably better alternatives until you are north of $ 100. ",4
208,"Think about this as an artist tool. And for each job, there is the ""right"" tool. Is it the best distortion pedal? It really depends on the sound you are trying to get and what other speed / technical you use with it. If you use bad speed or poor technique, it will not make miracles. It will not make your SoundBlaster soundder of 15 Watts solid Ibanez Sound as an orange rockerver ragir and will only make coils alone like EMG 81 / 85S. But arguing on which pedal is ""better"", it's like two painters are competing with what color is best used to paint a sunrise. This pedal is good for a tight type of distortion - but not so heavy that you can make modern metal if you run in a black amp - if it makes sense. It does not make sense, there are many opinions from YouTube that you can check before shooting the shutter button. It has been used by professional players such as Steve Vai, Joe Satriani and Kurt Cobain. It is a professional pedal used by professional musicians. It is built like a brick and durable as all the outings. I found the mine used for $ 20, but the new asked price is right. I would like to see the boss start using True Bypass instead of the buffered bypass they use, but with certainty, I do not detect any tone with her. I directed mine in a tube amp on the edge of the break and it can really cook things. There is also an overdrive or an offshore to bang the gain and get tracks. With the exception of ""modeling"" type pedals such as Tech 21, I do not think the Sterboxes - this included - optimally work when you encounter a solid state amp. So, if you are not satisfied with the way it deforms your Marshall MG, the problem is in your amp. ",4

With the exception of 'modeler' pedals of companies such as tech 21, I don't think that dirt boxes - this included - performs optimally when performing a solid state amplifier.

I used it on the amps of the solid state of Marshall and Vox tube amps. Fender Single coils and guitars with humbuckers.

Any number of mods can be found online to change the sound. They are usually on the side of the improvement of the stock tone, which I am satisfied. I have always liked the parametric equation of this pedal. The Midrange variable allows me to get Marshall or Mesa flavors. For most metal / tough rock music, the gain range is sufficient for me. If I need more gain, I hit it with an overdrive, or a compressor pedal for a cleaner boost. Even without boost, I can use it for metal death.

I started playing with a group that required a dirty tone that I had the impression that I could only be reached by a pedal. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals, I used the Dod Death Metal for years when I started playing. However, there is a disadvantage.

Read the supplied book, search for MP3s on online videos and check out other guitarist settings. This will help you tame this pedal in what you want. Perfect pedal for those who do not want to spend a lot of things. There are also mods that you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers who open it even more to shape and make it more useful. I have seen a lot of complaints about the pedal that looked like just fuzz. I must say learn to shape the sound, spend time composing it to your platform. In the 10 minutes, I was satisfied with the MT-2. I used it on my Overdrive channel to push it stronger and have a very thick and thick distortion with a good answer.I say that MT-2 deserves an investment if you are looking for a great deformation of a small pedal.

You lose a low low end when it is engaged, but it works very well for prospects, especially with humbuckers or amps with a kind of ""classic"" distortion encountered with EL84S. As stand alone overdrive, I prefer other pedals. But where this pedal really works for me, it's a boost for other drain jars or an amp already occurred. You get sing, harmonic ducts when it is composed of right. Like any overdrive, you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can become Hissy while you are changing palm if you handle it too far. I am a Dirtbox helicopter and I like to pivot the pedals and try different combinations. Recently, I execute it in either V1 Cool Cat Transparent Trandrive (Timmy Clone - very, very nice) or the Behringer BO-100 (which is a dead ring for the boss's blues driver) and then in A tube amp composed of on the light crunch (Jet City or Palomino combo). As for any overdrive, this thing will not sound very good (IMHO) running in a solid state amp. It's just not what it was destined to do. It was intended to drive saturation preamp tubes but YMMV. Because I am a good market (and because these things are lasting like bricks), I bought it for $ 20, but it's worth the new price requested. ",4

In addition, I have several overdrive pedals, this is good to give a number of basic overdrive shades. I can get decent tones from a telecaster and les Psul by keeping the level and the tone buttons under 12 hours and adjust the drive to taste. The od sounds great by Fender clean tubes and I also tried it with a bass guitar. With some adjustment of the sound and drive knob, the bass has an overhead show with a good disk. The other reviews here prove this pedal is typical and iconic boss in building quality. I think the Baa pedals are good for their goal and have the people I have had over time, but I can be this as it is and use it as a boost. These pedals last beforeever and I only paid $ 20 for mine.

My son had an exit on him in the middle of a jitter last weekend.

410,"I always find interesting the different opinions about the products. Some do not like the sound, others say that they wear out in a day (really - do you play for 24 hours?). Some say that the handle is good. Here is my grip - for what it goes. I listened to them with hollow and semi-hollow body guitars. Round and flat ropes. My Pond General is that these choices give a better rounder tone even more round. Compared to the turtle style selection material (1 mm for the Tortex). It is a bit difficult to determine if the sound comes from the material, thickness or combination of both. Note also, I play with the rounded edge, not the tip. So the handle in the center of these does not quite fit my gripping style, but it's always correct. I think they become slippery faster than Tortex materials if my hands sweat at all. I am subjective in my comparisons - but that's what I found so far. I think they are distinguished, wise wise, for guitars that I currently play. The search process for the ""right"" choice is never finished and changed over time. Give this a try and let me know what you think. ",4

436,"I thought I would like to throw my two cents about the new conception and effectiveness of this Sondole humidifier.After creating some homemade case humidifiers from things like a travel butter container with many holes pierced and a sponge, I started thinking about how some of the cases separate the body cavity from the cavity of the neck and the pusher inside the guitar case and does not allow the moisture to circulate freely In all areas, especially the body where it is necessary the most. Although I receive an acceptable moistening in the case, I was concerned about the body being dried in comparison, so I went forward and folly the $ 8 on them. (In fact, I bought three of them.) I ate the heating gas in the house in winter and summer in summer, keep my guitars in their cases and inside a wardrobe. The moisture falls quite low, but the sponges remain wet for several days before I can not fight the desire to restore them. LOL.TWO GREAT TIPS IN A: Use a regular and denser, thicker sponge like those of the Dollar store. Cut them to the waist and trick them! Take the sponge when it starts to become Tucky and do not worry about distilled water unless you want it. I can not discuss using very pure water compared to the potentially toxic shit that comes out of our faucets, but for a dollar, you can get a boat load from among them after you cut them to The size and throw them void when you need to replace yourself do not worry about the thing & n ?? 34; thing and # 34; Suspend between your ropes. This will not damage nothing unless you have the sponge too saturated and it flees. I will either turn off the excess water or shake the container with the sponge inside until I am not satisfied with not dripping stress or damage to your ropes by spreading them when you disparate when you hold this in your golden hole. What you are rough, carefree, irrefrupany, or stupid, you might be able to hit this coward and have rubbed or fall, but I would be more worried about the guitar and what would it be necessary for this to happen. This would be more extreme on the guitar than the humidifier or any damage it could cause. The summit snaps into tighten the sides to release small tabs that stick through the top cover. The sponge inside is quite small and there is not too much room for a much larger sponge. The device is simple and strong enough. Treat it gently and it will last forever. You can easily clean the inside or manage it through a dishwasher. If you give inside a fast rinsing all the few fillings, I'm sure it would be a decade above all and # 34; Built & # 34; Require many cleaning or replacements. Keep an eye on this one during the first days, then weeks to get an idea of ?€??€?the rem??ventration of the sponge. So that the sponge is wet when it is dry. I strongly suggests getting an oasis case humidifier, (or similar) mini dimensioned about 1 & # 34; X 4 & # 34; Cossant about 17-20 bucks.This prevention of the equation and will give you quite accurate readings inside your guitar or your instrument case. Remember too much moisture for your acoustic guitar to deform. Too dry and it will decrease and fissure, fendra the soundtrack (high) also leaving the edges of the frets that look like the spine of a fish and quite abrasive! If you were spending more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold and / or dry, you would be negligent (if not careless) to spend the pittance to make sure your ""baby is not thirsty"" or worse. .. dead and broken! I hope this will help you! ",4
437,"I thought I'd throw my two cents about the new design and the effectiveness of the soundhole humidifier. After making a few homemade kofferbevochtigers from things like a butter container with lots of holes in them and a sponge, I brought it to think how some of the cases the body cavity separating the cavity of the neck and head in the guitar case and not allow humidity freely string in all areas, especially the body where it is most needed. Case I was concerned about the body that was in comparison, so I went ahead and distributes eight dollars on this. (I actually bought three of them.) I push the gas heat in the house in winter and A / C in the summer, keep my guitars in their cases, and in a cabinet. The humidity drops quite low, but the sponges remain moist fought a few days before I can no longer fight the urge to moisten them again. lol.two great tips in one: use a regular, more dense sponge thicker as the Dollar Store. Cut them to size and stuff them in! Discard the sponge away when it starts to pick up and do not worry about distilled water, unless you want to. I can not argue with a very pure water compared to the potentially toxic crap that comes out of our taps, but for one dollar you can get a boat load after you've customized, and throw them away without any comment. Do not worry about the & # 34; thing & # 34; hanging between your strings. It will not hurt, unless you get the sponge saturated and leaking. I will pick out the excess water, or in shaking the container with the sponge until I am satisfied that it will not drip. The humidifier will not stress or damage to your strings by circulating it when you spread it on your sound hole. If you're rude, careless, thoughtless or stupid, you could hit it loose and let rub or fall, but I'd be more worried about the guitar and what it would do to make it happen before. This would be extreme for the guitar than the humidifier or any damage it might cause. The top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release small stabbing tabs on the top cover. The sponge inside is quite small and there is not much room for a much larger sponge. The device is simple and fairly solid. Treat it gently and it lasts forever.

If you get the inside gives a quick rinse every few fillings, I'm sure it would be a decade before all and # 34; built and # 34; In order to require extensive cleaning or replacement. Hook the first few days in the holes and then weeks to get a sense if you need to re-moisten the sponge. It is to keep the sponge wet and dry. I strongly suggests Oasis Case Humidifier (or similar) Sample size about 1 & # 34; X 4 and # 34; Costing around 17-20 Bucks.Dit takes the guesswork out of the equation and give reasonably accurate measurements in your guitar or instrumentencase.Remember, too much humidity can acoustic guitar to warberen. Too dry and it will shrink and crack, split the soundboard (top) and also allows the edges of the frets leave as the backbone of a fish and quite abrasive! If you have more than one hundred dollars you spent on your guitar and where it is spent cold and / or dry, you would be remiss (if not imprudent) to spend the pittance to ensure that you ""baby not thirsty,"" or worse ... dead and broken!

438,"This is a simple humidifier for guitars with a hole of his round. This would not work for an archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele. Inside the robust plastic case is what seems to be an ordinary kitchen sponge. If you use distilled water (as recommended), it should last a while. The top comes off from a soft press on the sides. The dry sponge can be a bit difficult to eliminate with fingers, but tweezers or needle clamps work perfectly. Do not push all this after the humidification and you will not have a problem. I'm waiting for a small distilled water on the sponge, emitting any excess, and the assembled housing appears easily between the D and G ropes, suspended in the middle of the sound hole.

If the sponge did not disregard wet, you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or business. When moisture is very low (30% or less), the sponge dry in 2 to 3 days, even if the case is not open. As with most humidifiers of this type, you will have to check every two days. If you have ever had a crack in the top of the favorite guitar (or you do not want to see one), use a guitar humidifier! Especially during the winter - heating a house tends to give up the domestic moisture below the safety levels (between 45% and 60% is ideal for most guitars). Air conditioning can do the same thing. For particularly valuable guitars, it would be useful to buy a hygrometer to stay in the case, but for most guitars to have one in the room where you keep your guitar, it's good. For many reasons, it is always better to keep your guitar in a concert case or bag when not in use.

439,"This is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole. It would not work for a F-hole archt or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele. Within the sturdy plastic housing is what looks like a normal kitchen sponge. If you use distilled water (as recommended) it must take a while. The top comes with a light pressure on the sides. The dry sponge can be a bit hard to remove with the fingers, but tweezers or a tongs work perfectly. Don't push it all the way after moistening and you will not have a problem. I drip some distilled water to the sponge, squeeze the excess, and the composite case jumps into simple between the D and G strings, suspended in the middle of the sound hole.

They made it thinner so that it will not remove the ropes and consequently, it will only be necessary for a fine sponge that dries easily as far as Arizona and California .Suggestion to Planet Waves: I think you can make it thicker but instead of splitting the ropes, redraw the mount, say with a velcro so that it always hangs on the sound room, but it is attached to the ropes. It is possible to attach your product differently because I changed the mine and my personal preference works without dividing the screen. ",4

When installing these strings, I cannot really see a lot of difference in size of the regular light meter, but maybe it's too small to notice with the naked eye. I am not entirely sure that these strings were louder or clear improvement about the old daddario strings they have replaced. They may be a little brighter or have more clarity because of new. The guitar that I use them is a small body with a nice soft sound, so everything sounds beautiful and smooth. Overall I am satisfied with the sound and performance of the new strings, but I don't think I'm ready to give Daddarios. ",4

Suddenly, an incredible clarity came to me and I realized, the version of the bass has to adjust only four ropes instead of six. So, it costs less because we do not need to use so much! But then I remembered that there are 5 string bass guitars and I thought, okay ... Should not he have $ 5.99 one for 5-string bass guitars? Unfortunately universal clarity has become even hottest when I made with consternation that there are even 6-string bass guitars. Will it work even on a 6 strings?

I would recommend putting a drop of super glue in the thread zone of the screw to attach the screw and prevent that. Because of this design, a 4-star fault instead of 5.I not noting criticism here as old as four years ... and it seems that this device has undergone design changes during this period . Some say that the bowl of the head is so deep that it can cause a scratch of the guitar head. Others report that it's so superficial, he slips on the keys. What I believe is that it's a mistake to sell the guitar version of the bass and the same page. From what I can deduct from exams, it seems that some people inadvertently bought the version of the bass guitar, which has indeed a wide and deep cup and did not realize it. IMHO, the two products must appear on two different pages of clarity. It is obvious criticism that some people accidentally bought bad unit. Some reported that the ankle extractor is ""metal"" and scratching the bridge. The one on mine is vinyl and it is hard enough to scrape the bridge if we do not want to pay attention, the same goes for the needle nose clamp.The line is a certain responsibility of the user to pay attention to ""do not do, do not rush, and be aware of the need to protect their instrument when using any modification tool. I guess if we will cross in a hurry and Trying to change ropes from 0 to 60 in 5 seconds ... They can prevent harming their guitar. Turn on the light, put play glasses if necessary to see ... and take your time and device should work properly . Be aware of reading the critics that many seem to be obsolete (Dunno why the company simply has not started a new list when repression of the device). ",4
609,"When I first saw myself, I wondered: Why is the ordinary guitar version $ 6.99 and the basse only $ 4.99? Suddenly a great clarity came across me and I realized ... The basse just needs to tame four strings instead of six. So it costs less because we don't have to use it so much! But then I remembered that there are 5 string bass guitars and I thought, okay ... they don't have to have $ 5.99 for 5-string bass guitars? Unfortunately the universal clarity became even more than I realized with some dismay that there are even 6-string bass guitars. Will this even work on a 6-string bass? After all, that is 2 more strings than the intended goal! These bewildering questions aside, I think this is an excellent and ideal tool. The function is triple: 1) String Winder2) String Cutter3) POLERSO no longer running for the wire clippers to draw a pin or cut a string. All tools you need to change strings are in this a reasonably priced tool. Made by d'Addario, the quality lives on the brand. It is solid, the wire cutter and PEG puller well designed. It is all that it should do that it does well and is good construction.pros: good strong well-designed unitcons: the winder is held by a single screw and there are countless reports of that screw that are loosened during use . I would recommend to set a drop of super glue into the threaded area to attach the screw and to prevent that happening. Because of this design error 4 stars instead of 5.I note that there are reviews here, as old as four years ... and it seems that this device has undergone the design of the design at that time. Some say the cup tray is so deep that it can result in scratches on the guitar head. Others report that it is so superficial, it slips from the keys. What I believe is that it is a mistake to sell the basic and standard guitar version on the same page. What I can deduce from the reviews, it seems that some people accidentally bought the bass guitar version, which indeed has a wide and deep cup, and it didn't realize it. Imho, the two products must be mentioned on two different pages for clarity. It is clear from the reviews that some people accidentally bought the wrong unity. Some have reported that the PEG puller is ""metal"" and scratch the bridge. The one on mine is vinyl and although it is hard enough to scratch the bridge if someone is not careful-- The same applies to Naaldneustang. Bottom line there is any responsibility of the user to pay attention to what they are doing, do not get in a rush, and have the need to protect them to protect them back using all modification tool. I suspect that if you rush and try to change the cuts 0 to 60 in 5 seconds ... they can damage their guitar. Turn the light in, place the reading glasses if necessary to see ... and take your time and this device should work properly. Please note when reading reviews that many resemble (Dunno, why didn't the company simply a new offer when the appliance is re-designed). ",4

I pulled them but I had trouble adjusting the guitar. Whenever I had the upper chains in phase, the Bowers would go down as much as half a note. It took a moment to realize that my floating bridge came out of the body while I would tighten the ropes. So, I pulled my strat back and started turning off the tension screws. I did about 5 adjustments every time reducing the guitar to check my progress. The last time I brought them, the High E string broke out. Since these were my only Costaud, my day was made with these ropes. However, since how far I stay the tension screws, I think I should have purchased an extra tension spring (not too expensive or hard to install if you have the inclination to do it) to get the bridge rinse with the body. I said, it's not a typing of these ropes. I never really had the chance to play them. Just a head for anyone to have heavier strings.

This produces a much less bright and deaf sound. I have an old Koa guitar so brilliant that I can not stand with standard channels. The elixir polywebs tone to the point where it is perfect.

I saw all the big critics for this strap and affordable price and took a chance. I am pleased to do so. This strap may not be as elegant as the fine leather, but it is extremely good and feels very durable and substantial in its construction. What cut me was that my complete Banjo Banjo ring, which weighs about 14 pounds, literally felt half as heavy. This is not a joke. At first, the feeling was insensitive, because the strap has some elastic give it. You get this double sensation of a) the banjo feeling super light and b) as if the banjo will flow on the ground. Paradoxic I know, but that's where the magic of this strap is. It's almost as if the Banjo floated in front of you, but in reality it goes back very stable when reading. As I said, the quality of construction is exceptional. My only concept of the design is that it is very modern and not traditional, so you must also get used to the contrast of a traditional instrument, like a Bluegrass banjo with 5 strings and the new style and the design of this strap. It's not just a good strap for money rather it's a big strap at all costs.

Last year, I went to Addario Exp16 because they seemed better on the guitar that I now, but always keep a packet of Nanowebs as backup. Here are my advantages and disadvantages of this chain: advantages: + easier to fretter and play than other ropes. I do not know why; I looked at the voltage statistics on these ropes and they seem to be equivalent or higher than those of other ropes. But they are certainly easier to crack (press Down) and play that any other string I tried, including other coatings. The coating on Nanoweb channels is thinner than the Elixir PolyWeb series, but still feels very smooth and even ""slippery"", as some people have noticed. They have very little rope squeaks. + Derrer longer than all the other ropes I have tried - maybe because of their brightness, these fluffy ropes with age (like all strings do it) but never seem really boring. The only reason I saw to change them was when they became too dirty or broken, usually every few months of regular play. + The very bright sound, which cuts well play live with a complete group and live the sound of cheaper guitars. However, this can also be a con (see below) disadvantages: -Cost more than most ropes, including other covered ropes. - Can sound too bright, especially on some upper end guitars. They tend to dominate the sound of the guitar, which is good for cheaper guitars without quality or construction, but not so good for a guitar that already resonates well. For this reason, I went to the phosphorus expound bronze chain for my current guitar. The Exp16 is coated but has a more natural / dark sound that complements the ""lignity"" of the guitar better than the elixirs (although not as easy to play). - Not available for export outside the United States when I worked abroad, I used to buy them from an American company that would send it to me.

Nothing I used until this point has become near the quality of the quality of the powerful purple box.The sound you get from them on day 1 is crisp and beautiful as expected. This is not that the elixirs, however, kill competition. It is after 20 hours of play they show their strength. You will always hear fresh and brilliant tones of 'them when any other set would have already crossed the dead zone. In fact, I usually start to break them before starting to sound too boring. I play relatively aggressively and constantly use the palm permanently, allowing the skin oils to eat through the strings of the bridge.Sayant that the tone lasts longer (as indicated on the box) could be a stretching, but it is not There is no doubt that you get at least the life of these less than twice the cost of alternatives. If you are an occasional player or a music workshop owner, it's obvious. The coating is extremely effective in combating the effects of time and exposure to oxygen. For the daily and aggressive player, you will simply get a better tone and longer life. Nit-Picky critic point: The packaging is a problem for me. Why does a manufacturer always use paper envelopes that allow chains to hinder? I'm seriously asking! I have to miss something here. A plastic marker sealed around the 6 channels is more green, more profitable, and it keeps the fresh ropes (thank you from addario, I will never leave your electric channels). I would buy happiness of wholesale elixirs if I trusted in their shelf life. The complaints about these sensors prematurely are probably valid, what happens when someone gets a set that has been sitting for a moment.

You still hear fresh, clear tones of them when another set would have been crossed in the dead zone. In fact, I usually start breaking them before they start to sound too boring. I play relatively aggressive and constantly use the palmmuting, so that skin oils can eat directly through the strings on the bridge. Should the tone last 3.5x longer (as stated in the box) can be a stretch, but there is no question of having to get the life of life less than twice the costs of alternatives. If you occasionally have a player or owner of a music store, this is a no-brainer. The coating is extremely effective in combating the effects of time and oxygen exposure. For everyday, aggressive player you simply get a better tone and a longer lifespan. A NIT picky point of criticism: the packaging is a problem for me. Why would every manufacturer still use tree-murder paper envelopes with which strings become old? I ask it seriously! I have to miss something here. A shred of plastic sealed around all 6 strings is greener, more cost efficiency, and it keeps the strings verse (thank you d'Addario, I will never leave your electric strings). I would like to buy elixirs in bulk if I had faith in their shelf life. Complaints about this pike are valid prematurely, there is probably happening when someone gets a set that has been around for a while. Think of them as a perishable and buy them from places that move many units (such as Amazon :) ",4
656,"The time will say if they last longer than the ropes 1 / 3rd the price. Visually, they do not appear different from cheaper bronze wound ropes. I expected something different, but as far as the sound, the ropes have settled well and did not necessitate a few times of time to get them to stay in phase, even after playing and # 34; Notes of smear & # 34; On several songs. My problem with cheaper chains (degelo) was that they will tarnished or rust quickly, the winding would lose and harm the inner string on the fret brands on the guitar. The company claims these are treated to prevent corrosion and should last 3 to 5 times longer. I will know in a few weeks if this statement is true or not. As they are literally triple the cost, I will know if it was worth the extra punishment. Let's hope that these are made in the United States instead of China, like most other things we buy in America. Good or bad, once I see the longevity of this set, I will add to this exam at that time. ",4
657,"The time will see if they last longer than strings 1 / 3th the price. They don't seem to be different than cheaper bronze wound cords visually. I expected something else, but as far as the sound goes, the strings are well coordinated and only 3 times some needed to let them get in the tune even after playing and # 34; Smearnotes & # 34; on different songs. My problem with cheaper strings (de'Angelo) was that they would quickly target or rust, the winding would lose and cherish the inner string over the FRET characters on the guitar. The company claims that these are treated to prevent corrosion and must last 3 to 5 times longer. I will know it in a few weeks as that statement is true or not. Because these are literally the costs, I will know if it was worth the extra costs. Hopefully these will be made in the US instead of China, like most other things we buy in America. Good or bad, as soon as I see the lifetime of this set, I add this review to this assessment at that time. ",4
658,"These are perfect. Hard to beat ropes. They last, stay in phase and keep their tone. They do not need rope cleaners either. So you can save money about it.

664,"I love these ropes, because I have sweaty hands that tend to make my guitars corroding and rusting very quickly. I can play a guitar once and leave there for 2-3 weeks, and the ropes will be rusty and wicked when I come back. I am now rubbing the ropes completely after each session that plays them, but this little ball is happening. They arrived through these Nanowebs Elixir. They are tall. I no longer need to rub my ropes so carefully, and they remain rusty and without a gide for more than 2 weeks (regular play). However, I met a strange thing. By playing during a repetition, my electronic channel has just jump and broken, hurting my finger a little. I was surprised, because externally the chain did not seem to say that it is the disadvantage. With regular channels, you can say that the chain is close to the end of its life B / C, it looks really bad. With these, they can always look good but be close to break. It made me a little caution. I still prefer these 100% on other ropes, though. ",4
665,"I really love these strings because I have sweaty hands that tend to have the strings corrode on my guitars and rust very quickly. Once I can play a guitar and leave 2-3 weeks, and the strings will be rusty and filthy when I go back to it. I now rub the series thoroughly after every session is playing, but this quiet happens. There I happened about this Elixir Nanowebs. They are great. I no longer have to rub my cords so thoroughly, and they remain rust and gunk free for 2+ weeks (from regularly playing). However, I have come across a strange thing. While playing during a rehearsal, my e-belches cut and broke and broke my finger a little pain. I was surprised, because the string didn't see that bad. So that's the disadvantage. With normal strings you can tell that the string is at the end of his life, it looks very bad. With this they can still look good, but be close to breaking. Made me a little careful. I still prefer these 100% compared to other strings. ",4

672,"I put a set of Elixir Nanoweb Custom Light Cordings on my main acoustic guitar maybe a few months. Although I do not play concerts on it, I play guitar just about every day, or maybe every other day. The custom lights are wonderful: great durability, a beautiful tone and projection, easy on the fingers. I bought a set of Extra Lights elixir for a travel guitar Laguna 3/4. The reasoning was that the lighter body guitar with a shorter scale could use lighter chains, thus putting less stress on the body. Compared to the addario light chains that came with the guitar, they have a string more muffled. The rope too, do not project as much as standard chains. Although I did not try the extra lights on my full size acoustics, I suspect that the lower strings would not have the presence or ring of other brands. Even with the custom light game - where the lower chains are a heavier gauge than a normal light set - the bass notes have a slight suspicion of stifled quality. The thing most elixirs players seem to talk about is playability and durability. They are softer feelings than uncoated ropes and certainly do not degrade because of perspiration almost as quickly as regular ropes. The other thing that is important to know is that the elixir are excellent to hold a melody, once they are stretched and broken. That being said, I'm not sure of putting the extra lights on the laguna because of the problem of bass projection: a little guitar has few bass to start and these channels do not help. As you may have guessed, however, I am completely convinced of the personalized lights of normal acoustics. ",4

I bought a set of the Elixir extra lights for a Laguna 3/4 Size Travel Guitar that I have.

The other that is important to know is that the elixirs are excellent in holding a tune, once they are stretched and broken. That said, I'm not sure if I would put the extra lights on the Laguna again because of the problem of the bea projection: a small guitar has little enough bass to start with and don't help these strings.

678,"I would first like to say that I bought this guitar on Amazon for about $ 65, much cheaper than sold now (currently $ 111). It's a wonderful guitar for an inexpensive solid body, but it seems a little different from what the image would lead you to believe. For one, the guitar does not have a ""finish"", not even a brilliant green layer - it's solid column wood, smooth sandblasted and given a deep wood spot. Second, the guitar is described as much lighter than that it really is. The picture shows that it almost looks like a red wood; In reality, it is a much darker dark brown, like coffee. However, it does not affect its playability, which is wonderful. I have a little buzz on a fret, but it can easily be corrected with good sanding and a good varnish. The guitar can also be threaded and set easily, however with a guitar of this body style, you will need to go back on a continuous way until the chains retain a setting. It is a very heavy guitar and robust, and for a solid body with two humbuckers, you probably will not find one that also seems fleshy and smooth. ",4

The guitar can also be easily stretched and coordinated, but with every guitar of this body style you must constantly adjust to and-retune until the strings will keep a tuning.

682,"Recently, I built a cable project. A recommended friend to use the 4-way switch instead of the 3-way switch. This allows you to have the three positions normally found on a clip, a bridge only, a bridge + the parallel neck and the neck only.

The result of this added position is that you get a higher volume output from the guitar than in the ordinary bridge position + The neck and a slightly higher summit. Final output. This is clearly a case of & # 34; Your mileage may vary. & # 34; I was used to the traditional 3-position switch on my other tettelescripts. I am a little indifferent to this mod. If I built another guitar, I would probably use this switch again. That's what it is supposed to do and it's in a few dollars from the way to three.

It is sent on time and packed in the original Dunlop packaging. Article number: 83cb, made in the US! No counterfeiting here.

738,"Even if the title says ""acoustic guitar cases"", it is obvious that it is a case for mandolins to a style. I chose it because the lining looked a little more deeply on the photo and the critics were good. Of course, the lining is soft and well padded. The hardware works as appropriate, and the quality of construction is almost perfect. However, when closing the case, a small amount of Jiggling is necessary to make the seat up to the bottom correctly. Just a slight push-pull motion will allow the top to be depressed, then everything is as it should. The case perfectly matches my type A mandolin, and provides the protection needed to transport it safely in a car trunk or other place where it will be hit. The mild bad form of the top and bottom is not a sufficient concern to justify the referral of the case. It serves its purpose, at a reasonable price. ",4

In conclusion of the case, however, a small amount of jiggling is required to make the top on the bottom well.

Have bought all brands and pedal style (for the purpose of This, we will stick with the maintenance.). In relation to other units, it is heavier than most and I find the point where maintenance is committed to being just about comparing electronics to L acoustic. It's just a power switch, so no half-modeling here, the only reason I gave this unit. 4 stars instead of 5 is because Yamaha decided not to include polarity switch and aliener maybe 20% of the market that will come home and, s 'They did not think they would check, can be blocked with a pedal that undergoes when it does not undergo when it is not used when it is not used. and stops maintaining during pressure. A reverse holding pedal is not fun. Many manufacturer The actors include a simple polarity switch that would eliminate this potential headache. These days, most keyboards have the opportunity to change polarity inside a global defense or determine if the pedal is started at startup and adjustment accordingly (never press the holding pedal. While turning your keyboard, you can very well cause a problem that you do not wait and that you are confused by turning again without the depressed pedal disappearing in these cases.) So - Build quality, excellent. Sustainability - Excellent (I had a pile of cheaper pedals - used on stage - pause at the switching point or taking), this Yamaha supports. Design - some older pedals used a rubber rubber footrest supposed to make the pedal more secure - I do not see that a lot, but as long as you are not on the bare hardwood, it will stay, I place without problem. I have read some criticism that give this pedal a bad note because of what seems to be a change in a global frame on a keyboard or something similar, a holding pedal consists of a momentary contact switch, Engaged when the contact is performed by pressing the depressing and finished button and disengaged when the pedal is released. There is no electronics - if it does not work, there are three points to watch 1) Unscrew the plug and make sure the threads from the pedal are all connected to the metal poles inside the housing. There are usually two different color sons. If you are disconnected, the pedal will stop working (and, in rare instances, because the keyboard maintains all the notes indefinitely. This is easily corrected with a soldering iron and a little if the weld jacks are points of pressure so that it is strain points so that it is not ""t incanceable that a wire can come off. 2) The switch itself itself is out if it is damaged. The Yamaha pedals switches are of good quality and unless you receive a defective part, it would be unlikely that normal use. However, I need to take the pedal and make an adjustment. It was easy and a quick solution, even With limited tools. The third option is 3) the keyboard has had a modification of a global setting causing the operation of the reverse pedal. This can be corrected by consulting your owner's manual and read if your keyboard has a software polarity & # 34; Switch & # 34;, if it detects startup, or if you simply stopped working completely - do nothing at all - it's # 1 or 2 or a problem with the keypad (very unlikely,, but I I saw him arrive.). Hope this helps some who have posted questions. To conclude - a nice pedal for money, much better construction as the M-audio (decent, just as nice as the Yamaha - certainly not a bad unit) / on stage (if they can not get that most of Their microphone is well, I do not trust them with basic electronics ...) or generics.

In comparison with other units it is heavier than the Most and I find the point where it relates to only about the correct comparison of electronic to acoustic. It is only an on / off switch, so no half modeling here, the only reason I have given this device 4 stars instead of 5 because Yamaha decided not to take a polarity switch and alienated maybe 20% of the market coming home and, if they had not thought of checking, can be stuck with A pedal that stores when she is not used and stops supporting when pressed. A backwards Sustain pedal is not fun. Many manuf acturers include a simple reverse switch that would eliminate that potential headache. These days, most keyboards have the ability to switch the polarity internally, either through a global combustion or by detecting whether the pedal is switched on when starting up and adjusting accordingly (never press the SUSTAIN pedal while turning Your keyboard, you can very well cause a problem that you do not expect and confirmed by - back and disabled without the pedal depressed everything in those cases.)

There are no electronics - so - if it doesn't work, there are three points to look at 1) Loosen the connection and make sure that the wires come out of the pedal all connected to the metal piles in the housing. There are usually two wires of different color. If someone is disconnected, the pedal will stop to function (and, in rare cases, leave the keyboard to support all nuts for an indefinite period.

874,"I recently bought this guitar for my young girl based on the previous reviews. She joined the jazz group at her school and since she is smaller than the 12-year-old, she needed a smaller guitar. He was very well packaged and it took a while just to get the guitar out of the packaging. The only thing I found so far, this kind of disappointed was that there were dark spots on white choices. Trying to put the stains with a wet paper towel did not work, so I took a special soft and wet sponge made to eliminate the stains and rub it gently on the stains. They came out but the finish on the plastic custody is dull where I had rubbed the spots. This kind of irritated me. However, he did not seem to disturb my daughter almost as much as it made me. Do not have the episode stained, it suits him perfectly. I tried to grant him with a snark-on snark tuner. It did not work at all for any reason, so we went to the guitar center and bought an electric guitar tuner that you connect the cord of the guitar. It really worked well to grant the guitar. The adjustment stakes (gears) were rigid and somewhat difficult to rotate. When I change the chains, I will adjust them to make them easier to turn. The ropes The guitar comes with are very cheap, so I will have to change them soon for a much better set, but they will have to do for the moment. I have connected the guitar to my old cash amp and it sounded very well. The buttons at the front of the guitar become a did what they are supposed to do. It is easy to control the tone and volume of the guitar without having to dicker a lot with the amp. My daughter had a good time to get used to it. She is a great classic guitarist (I teach the classic guitar) then playing an electric guitar was a new experience for her. My old strat is too big and big for her and this black is good (despite the city that I could see) on her and she was awesome to play jazz guitar in her school concert the other night. Since this guitar is so inexpensive and is just just for a smaller person, I do not really find anything major to say about it. I'm glad I bought that, I just want it to have not come with stains. It feels solid, well constructed and not very heavy. I like playing too! I ordered a very good concert bag, new cord, a bitter amp just for her and of course, a group of new electric guitar chains. She will find little things in Christmas stocks! I can not wait until we do the electric guitar duet of the mother and the girl !! ",4

890,"I left my man fianced behind a job and I was about to replace him when I came to this alternative proposed by Amazon. As struck as a Manhasst can go weekend warriors like me who simply throw it on all the rest of the street before the long journey at home, I have never had any failure on me in the last 40 years. There is nothing on the stand that the user can even adjust, but all moving parts always seem to keep the right amount of tension, thus preventing the records from 5 to 10 pounds to lower the upper half or pass it from the front. But the ""friction"" is their non-adaptability. The feet on the base are permanently attached, just like the upper tray holding music. As a result, these omnipresent and well-proven stands can sometimes be a challenge to pack in a congested van or a sedan, especially with some keyboards, amps, instrument stands and other equipment required on board. It is only the music on Amazon stage the booth becomes attractive (of course, it does not hurt that it costs less than a mantec). It allows you to fold the legs at a position parallel to the tree as well as to completely remove the upper shelf that holds the music. Therefore, it is much easier to find a practical place - whether in the trunk or on the ground floor ground - to pack the stand. Just ""slide"" in position. The disadvantage - apart from the sustainability problems that some critics have warned (be careful not to override the vis-vis!) - Is this thing heavy. Frankly, I was expecting a light stand, at least compared to my old Manhasset, but if you have owned or if you have been around the latter, the first thing you are likely to notice with the booth on the snured here is a palpable and substantial substantial addition in weight. At the same time, with moving parts and adjusting screws (topped with plastic, rotating, teeth wheels), the stand on stage gives me the same amount of confidence in its durability, just like Manhasset - in other words, I am very less likely to become neglected and I simply mix it on the stack of gears after a long line of four-hour gig.bottom: the staging seems to be a good value - a truly robust stand (most Means) that will extremely well like a practice of practice in a studio or a lounge and who is easily agreed for jobs on the move. But do not expect it to ease your charge or, simply because it is heavier, last longer than a manhasset.si you do a lot of trips and do not plan to put one of these folders 1000 piano piano on the support, there is at least one really lightweight stand (well plastic) that is really well worked for me (perhaps useless to say that some are not - they are distinguished or so ingeniously Designed that it takes 15 minutes simply to disassemble them and put them back into their ruthless cases, pint of size). But the peak top is made to hold (in turn, it houses relatively heavy music books) and served me for several years (as I was about to condemn the stand, I called The company, they immediately answered by sending out a critical plastic piece that had become distorted and the peak summit has been without problems since). This will cost you a little more expensive, but not as much as some people are ready to spend in exchange for losing some unwanted books. ",4
891,"I left my trusted manhasset behind on a job and was about to replace it when I was offered this alternative by Amazon. As elevated as a manhasset can get from weekend warriors like myself who just informed about everything else in the backseat fling before the long drive home, I've never had anyone in the last 40+ years. There is nothing on the condition that the user can even change, but all the moving parts always seem the right amount of tension to maintain, making 5-10 pounds folders can dip to prevent the upper half or lower makes it forward. But the ""rub"" is not their adaptability. The feet on the base are permanently attached, like the top drawer that holds the music. Consequently, these ubiquitous, proven booths sometimes be challenging in a crowded bus or sedan to tackle, especially with a few keyboards, amps, instrument stands and other required gear on board. This is where Amazon on-stage music stand is attractive (of course it does not hurt that it costs less than a manhasset). It allows you to move the legs to fold to a position parallel to the axis and to completely remove the top shelf that holds the music. Consequently, it is much easier to find a convenient place - be it in the trunk or on the floor of the back seat - for packing standard. Quite simply ""push"" into position. The disadvantage of the durability of sustainability have warned some reviewers (make sure you set the screws does not transfer!) - Is this thing is heavy. Frankly, I was expecting a lightweight stand, at least compared to my old Manhasset, but if you had to own or around the last one, the first thing you'll probably notice displayed by default is a tangible, substantial addition in weight. Simultaneously with the moving parts and the set screws (topped by plastic, rotating, toothed wheels), represents the state of the on-stage is not the same amount of confidence in the sustainability, like manhasset - in other words, I am very less tend to be out and throw it on top of the gears after a long, exhausting four-hour gig.bottom line: to be a good value appears on stage - a Really heavy mode (in most respects) doing very well as an exercise in a studio or living room and wrapped favorable for traveling jobs. But do not expect that you load or simply because it is heavier to last longer than a manhasset.if you travel a lot and do not plan to put one of those piano folders 1,000 pages on the stand to , there is at least one really lightweight (albeit plastic) mode, which is really good for me (perhaps needless to say, some do not - they fall apart or they are so ingeniously designed that the 15 minutes it takes to make them take easy to dismantle them and put them back in their failed cases of pint-sized). But the peak standard is designed to hold to (in turn, has relatively heavy music books) and for several years served me well (just as I was about to order the state to, I called the company, they responded immediately sending out a critical plastic piece that had become warped, and piekstandel has since been without problems). It will cost you a little more but not as much as some people are willing to spend on exchange for losing a few unwanted kilos. ",4

I also use standard GHS .010 sets, and they are good too. My favorites are the sets of Ernie bullets, but they rarely leave for sale. I do not remember who makes which chains for which companies.

I also use the GHS standard .010 sets, and they are good too. My faves are the Ernie Ball sets, but they rarely go on sale. I don't remember who makes some cord for which companies. With offshore production a standard thing now, it is not told what they are actually out. I doubt whether the GFS strings are domestic production. ",4

Color options are currently seem to be limited to black, but if you have DIY skills , you can also like to paint you. This is a decent purchase, under the level of two dollars.

To my taste, the loop is too long where she flies around the plush / walnut zone, so I just tied it.

However, people with new brilliant expensive guitars might want to take note: while the nylon lace that wraps is nice and strong, it's quite difficult and abrasive, and my experience is that it will certainly carry in the end your git in this area. Will not rub the end or anything of this degree, but if you are squeakying to maintain the cosmetic perfection of your guitar (what I am not), you will certainly notice the finish rubbed and erupping and even torn a little there at points of contact.

A pulse protector is present, but when I removed the plastic shipping protector, all the guard came with her. The adhesive residue comes right away, so I'm going to play guitar without Pickguard. The bracing is light - all the guitar is light. The body is a little bigger in the lower corner that expected, but it is sitting on the knees more comfortably than a dreadnought. I preoccupy the suggestions of the examiners according to which it would be a good beginner guitar out of the box. The spacing of the strings at the nut is narrower than should be for the width of the neck, clinging the fingers. The nut must be replaced by the one with the ropes through the touch a little more. The action can be lowered by shaving the bridge saddle very carefully and just a little at a time. This work will cost as much as the cost of the guitar if you take it to a luthier, but if you can do it yourself, improve the playability of the instrument. The ropes supplied on the guitar were tin and cheap, so I replaced them with a set of Aldoario Ej-16 Light Phosphor-Bronze. The improvement of the tone was immediate - this little guitar seems pretty good.

This work will cost so much as the guitar costs if you take it to a gitutier, but if you can do it yourself, it will improve the playability of the instrument. The strings supplied on the guitar were blind and cheap, so I have them a set of d'Addario EJ-16 light phosphorus bronze. The improvement of the tone was immediately - this little guitar sounds pretty good. All in all, with careful modification, this is a good guitar for the beginners or informal player, and a very acceptable for the experienced guitarist who can do a little modification. ",4
1100,"I did not play a guitar in several years and I decided to come back. Having had a Carpian tunnel surgery a few months ago and having small hands to start, I started looking for guitars with a narrow neck. Takamine's jasmine continued to come and really had good reviews, so I decided to try it, buying the S34C. First, he was delivered quickly as requested and arrived in perfect condition, with really beautiful ropes. He has a nice honey gold finish on the front of the body, which had attracted me to the guitar in the first place. I really appreciate the cutting. How many notes will I hit on this baby? Who knows, but it looks good cool, lol! Crafts, at least in my unrequyed eyes, looks superb. I was not too crazy about the pickguard with all the lettering about it, but I finally understood that the lettering was just a sticker that can be easily removed. And the sound ... just charming, with this ring tone, we expected a steel stringed guitar, but with beautiful soft tones where too needs. I'm so jazzy how wonderful this guitar is, I take video classes online and I'm learning a storm of chords and fingering techniques! Hey, I do not expect to be a Leo Kottke or Martin Simpson at any time soon, but I have something to shoot on it, and we all need a dream! If you are looking for a great guitar at a very reasonable price, look no longer. Oh, the reason I gave only four stars is the neck really seems to be anything that is narrow after all. But, maybe it's just my little child's hands. Inch with little finger, I can hardly reach an octave on piano. And there go! ",4

1102,"Purchased a Takamine 40 years ago. It was an exceptional guitar for which I paid $ 125. Adjusted for inflation, it would be $ 800 when I bought this jasmine. I had a superb machine for money. Simply superb. It's not my old takamine, but the negative differences are light and there are only two three days to my knowledge with this guitar. The first is that the finish is not as good. Sanding between the coats was skim, which means that the finish at the front has a texture; The sides of the guitar are also a little rough. The second probably flows from the first. The tone is a wooden touch; It does not sing like the former Taka has made.positives: the intonation is true at the twelfth freet, and it is playable (and pleasant to play) with a slide. After the last focus of the ropes, he stayed in Tune. For its price, this guitar is a superb introduction to play. A very young child, or a small woman, will find this guitar a little big and deep for the real game. Comfort. For everyone, it should be comfortable enough. The intonation is true at the twelfth fret, and it is playable (and pleasant to play) with a slide. After the first development of the chains, he stayed at Tune.All beginner, and more than some intermediate players sensitive to costly cost will be satisfied with this guitar. ",4

1110,"This is my first attempt to purchase a polishing cloth for my guitars. I tried this ""untreated microfiberpolish fabric"" on my Gibson es-339 because I heard good things about it. We start with statistics: the fabric is 11-3 / 4 ""of 11-3 / 4 ""and has a 1/8"" border sewn around the edge. It feels very soft to the touch and it is made in Korea. There is a small warning on the package that states: ""not designed to clean electrical devices . ""You can also throw up untreated. Polish fabric in soft soap and water, rinse it and hang it dry. Now for the guitar, a hard lacquer finish ebony, which means very brilliant and brilliant. I have played Ceguitar for about a year and there was a lot finger buffers on the front and back of the body and put on the neck. I could get that most minor spots of the finger Current. When one passes after the multiple morateisisting stains, the Polish fabric spread it and let most of the problem of finish. What I discovered on this fabric, even with an increase in grease with elbow, it is that it has its link mitations.so, if your guitar is reasonably clean and that the spots are quite new, this cloth is dynamite and taken into account. If the body oils have been there for a while , probably collect dust, then you just go a kind of Cleaning liquid to help you break the old blurred oils of your instrument. Please use a liquid sparingly when applied to the surface of your instrument. Do not put liquid directly on the surface of your instrument. You must put the cleaning liquid on the Cleaning Cloth Prem??tThen apply it. I decided to use Dunlop's ""Dunlop Formula 65 guitar polishing"" to cut and clean the quench tasks. I used another soft cotton cloth and cleaned very well. Since then, I have been used to keep the polished guitar and clean using only ""Waves planet microfiber varnish"". This leaves no scratches or marks when used without liquid. I did not have any problems with the breakthrough break and leaving soft stuffed or pieces of fabric behind. You want to use another cloth to clean your cuff and not the same as you use for the finish. The coat makes a lot of fat dirt assigned to it by the repeated game. I would be afraid that the stubborn oils accumulated on the freight card enter the microfiber fabric and transfer to the finish of the guitar.so like a lot of things in life, there are limits to everything. I gave this 4-star microfiber fabric because it does a good job keeping my guitar clean and polite with minimal effort. My acute interruptions, based on the blur, were that this cloth cleans more oils and dirt against it.

When the Moreresistant Multiple Smudges would spread the Polish cloth and most of the problem on the finish.. what did I discover about this cloth, even with raised elbow fat, it is that the Li has mitations. So, if your guitar is fairly clean and the stains are fairly new, this canvas dynamite and Takesthem right.

My initial problem is that this thing does not come to deliver anywhere near to leave, the saddle moves, is not mounted and has a height adjustrs..So once I thought that, and also put some 3 3 in 1 oil on the nut, so when you adjust the ropes, which is right or wrong, J e do not know, I do not know, I did it without distinction of the nut at the 12th fret, then the 12th attracted to the saddle and moved the sad woman so that the two measures were really close, if you Meeting trouble with yours, I bet it's the problem, with your tuner defines your tight ropes ,,,,, It was another problem, this thing should be high, like the guy in the Geico Commraes (at New on you tube someone posted videos of tuning) I also read a very stiff choice, not for me, I guess I'm not sweet and crushed the ropes, could not keep the choice in my fingers. So I use a light, the reasons for using the steepness was the choice will not bend and create late, I suppose between the two channels (same note), the light weight that you work well for me (when I Choose this thing) It's not difficult to tune, I use my ukulele snarks and choose a string at a time, it's a cute guitar, no matter and I've seen one to sell in the guitar center for $ 75, identity.

This is one of these instruments where a case can cost as much or more than it does, so I will not worry about it. When you get it, the action is probably high and if you can not reduce the bridge enough with the wheels, it is easy enough of the bottom sand.

Just like another reviewer said, it's no miracles on a cheap uke, but it certainly helped a lot. The sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter. I love the sound.

1278,"I'm not sure how important I can say about a mute. It's easy to put and take off, and that does his job. It mutes the violin at a reasonable level. I used a remote SPL meter where an open sune chain g gave a reading of about + 2 dB. With the mute, he fell to -6db. I then tried a Yamaha muffler electric violin (unplugged) and the same distance, it is barely recorded. I recalibrated the meter so that the acoustic mute violin was read about 1 dB, and the Yamaha read about -6db at this distance and taking place. It will not make your instrument completely silent and a purely subjective perspective, it seemed to bring things closer to the silent violin, may seem to be about 10 to 20% stronger than I have not measured. With accessories, the tonal quality is generally important. But with a mute, you expect it to deteriorate. Surprising, there was a lot of tone, especially compared to unplugging electricity, but there was no active arte-beast or other horrible artifacts introduced. You can not expect that it gives a good silence or complete silence, but it will not disturb the neighbors or their dogs, and that will not make the dead death instrument. This is about 15 times cheaper than the cheapest silent violin, and they will probably seem worse. This is not the ultimate solution for calm, but it allows you to keep you on your instrument of choice. ",4

The very bad part (for me) is that I bought this to install in a newly purchased Behringer pedal card, supplied with 9V power supply. So, so that I can use this pedal in the map, I will have to run two different power supplies or run the battery pedal and everything that is out of the pedal power supply. [Behringer ...

I thought it's a bit strange that this thing specifies a 12 volt power adapter still can be powered by a 9 volt battery. So ... I decided to see if I have problems if I had used my power adapter to a task about it - corrected polarity, of course. It worked well.

I wanted to know if there would be a perceptible difference if I had used a 12-volt power supply.

There was no sonic modification, nor is the reduction in the volume of production I could hear. So what's new with the 12-volt adapter specification, Behringer? Have you thought you could deceive us all here? I give him four stars because even if you do not have to use the complete sweep of the pedal, it's just not very comfortable in these lower positions.

At once, Alice Cooper and his group used the Behringer XM8500's, but they may have moved now for everything I know. These clones are not SHURES SM-58, even if they seem to be cosmetic harnatures. They have a slightly hotter output and a more flat response to my ears while the shures have a lower lower boost that makes the male voice larger and sometimes more distorted if it is not correct correctly. They constitute an ideal backup voice microphone since the Behringer behaves like a compromise between a custom microphone for a male voice and a custom microphone for a female voice and works well without a thick. It is also if something more versatile than the SM-58, because it can be useful as a microphone of support for the acoustic instrument working for anything you usually use a SM-57 to pick up. It does not overload easily, has a high output and a tight scheme with the same feedback rejection as the SM-58. It has a reasonably decent explosion filter, so if you use for the pickup of the outer instrument, you do not have to add a windshield. Another force of these is durability. MES 3 have supported many drops, some falls occurred, while the ramp support mounted, so the microphone falls, but the weight of the arrow support was behind that adding more mass to the strength of the fall. No damage to one of them! I used to get stuck when they fell or fell wounded but now I'm just shrugging. A weak point about these is that they are more sensitive to noise manipulation, but on the sound of stand handling is not a problem. The mine has come to housings lined with hard plastic foam with stand adapters. Stand adapters are somehow fragile but usable. If you want SM-58, you need to buy SM-58's. If you want a good microphone tour around the $ 20 to $ 40, try one. No off off switch on these but we have switches on some of the SM-58 users and frankly the inactive switch is a liability! I do not think you can find a better new microphone for money and recommend them as a microphone all around around the price. You can pay more and get less. ",4
1301,"First of all, this is not the best microphone ever made. But for what they cost, they certainly more than I expected. I give it 4 stars as a microphone period, without even considering the low cost. They are so much better than the next cheap thing that they are certainly worth the extra $ 5. I bought a Behringer XM8500 a few months later planning to use them as a rehearsal microphones for a goezer-band start up for about 5 years. However, we have actually used this for singing with some live performances when the personal SM-58 of the Sound Tech are busy with a different task. To be honest, I think that we sound around the same every way and maybe a little clearer with the authorities. In one go, Alice Cooper and his band used the Behringer XM8500s, but they may now know for everything I know. These are not shure sm-58 clones, even though they seem to be cosmetic knockoffs. They have a slightly hotter-output and a more flat response to my ears, while the Shure's have a more pronounced lower mid-boost that makes the male voice greater and sometimes more distorted if it is not correct. They are an ideal backup of vocal microphone, as the Behringer behaves like a compromise between a microphone that is tailored to a male voice and a microphone that is tailored to a female voice and actually works well without heavy eq. It is also if there is something versatile than the SM-58, because it can be useful as an acoustic instrument pick-up microphone that works for everything you would usually use an SM-57 to pick up. It has no overload, has a high output and a sleek pattern with about the same feedback rejection as the SM-58. It has a fairly decent blast filter, so if you use it for outdoors, you don't have to add windshield. Another power of this is sustainability. My 3 have risen numerous drops, a few drops happened while tree was sent, so not only fell the microphone, but the weight of the tree stand was behind it that added more mass to the power of autumn. No damage to one of them! I always moaned when they fell or have fallen, but now I just hid it. A weak point about this is that they are more sensitive to handling sound, but at the stand of the position the sound becomes no problem. Mine came in hard plastic foam lined with standard adapters. The standard adapters are a kind of thin but usable. If you want SM-58, you must buy SM-58s. If you want a good all-microphone in the class of $ 20 to $ 40, try one of these. No on-off switch on it, but we have a part of the SM-58s that we use and frankly the on-off switch is a liability! I don't think you can find a better microphone new for the money and recommend them as a decent all-round microphone for the price. You can pay more and get less. ",4

1326,"Kudos to Fender to make an amp like this available at this price. It has 25 watts of power, a 10-inch speaker, a real spring reverb, and it is a traditional analog circuit without a digital processor. It will make your electric guitar sounds roughly the way it is supposed to. The disadvantage is that when I compared this amp that Fender was selling fifteen years ago, Champion 110, he falls a little short. The particle panel cabinet is thinner, the speaker is lower and everything feels and sounds a little less substantial. It is obvious that bean counters have really pushed to get this thing as inexpensive as that, and they also moved production in Indonesia of Mexico. Maybe the weight is a factor to send it through the ocean. All the same thing, I can always recommend it because it beats the shit digital amps and gives you a substantial power and a speaker of 10 ""And a real tone and looks and looks. Fender probably figures that players flock with species will prefer a well-made tube amplifier or an amp with tons of digital modeling, but I want some kind of wish they produce Always an analogue of 25 watts and a light giging amp.

It was built, with all the binding points that work accurately and securely. A few after the fact, I started worrying to know if I would have to look for an adapter with impedance correspondence capabilities. I am barely a professional technician in this field, but I did enough research to find a good job response: Lo-Z microphones (low impedance) (say that 1000 ohms or less) should generally not be adapted to The solid. -State amplifiers, which are likely to have Hi-Z (high impedance) entries in the range of 10,000 ohms. These AE amplifiers are generally designed to accommodate an impedance ratio of 10: 1 (source at source). I calculated the loss of signal of such an arrangement in the range of 0.83 decibels, which corresponds to what my ears tell me: this adapter works simply well without impedance. I can not say with certainty that it also holds tube amps, but I want to update my exam if I have a chance to find. Since I wrote my first criticism, I discovered that Pyle seems to have a problem to secure his connectors correctly with adjusting screws.

In case of doubt, consider changing your strings to a brand that is more suitable for the ""show"" you have in mind, be darker, brighter, softer, louder, etc. Strings make a big difference and I think it's it Use of d'Addario phosphorus bronze strings very clear and ringy, last long, are affordable and seem to be noticeably more than GHS or Ernie Ball. (Only steel strings - does not apply to nylon or intestinal strings.) Again, if you have a plastic saddle and / or nut, then these pins may not make much of a noticeable difference ... then they can again all the difference in the world ! You just have to try and see them. They are cheap and beautiful ... worth the risk! ",4

For the price, it worked much better than expected, but it took some adjustment to the ""trim screw"" on the receiver to obtain the clarity and the required range. We also had to record the small wire antenna of the small die so that it is not suspended in front of the speaker (it might not be a problem for you, depending on where you plug in).

The lower chains (E, A G) simply do not slide as easily as long as there is some accumulation. As a result, my fingers come out of the position and do not hit clear notes until I slipped these regions twice. It's probably due to oil and other Nazes accumulating in the ropes or I just get used to them. The packaging was also a little confusing. As there are two ropes with an envelope, it seems that I get the inverted channels too easily on the configuration. Other rope manufacturers I have tried, color has coded their ropes and has made much easier to bitch. Globally good channels and I will probably buy them again. ",4

1698,"It is difficult to really describe what this pedal does not deform, brew, echo or produce a chorus. I had heard that it made your amp seem as if someone had thrown a blanket. And because the words do not do a specific job to describe it, I probably have never removed the trigger on one (even if they are pretty cheap so that the pedals go). Like luck would have it, I acquired one on trade and I must admit that I agree with complete euphemism. This STOMPBOX helps to correct the sound booster of my Blues Jr. when placed at the end of my pedaltrain, just before meeting the amp. I do not think it should be run on a dedicated effect loop to improve the tone of an amp, although I think it works even better in a loop. I placed it in the effects loop of a Palomino V8 (USA / Ampeg Fabr??) and a VC508 crate (an EL84 tube amp of 5 watts in Celestian speaker) and it turned to the tone of the amps (tremendously). . It's done very well with simple coils. It's a pedal that I would leave all the time once my tone is composed. I do not think it works as well when I handle my LP in a jet-city combo - especially when you try to copy subtle textures / harmonics. This amp also lacks a loop of effects and I imagine that it would have a different effect if it is placed after the preamp phase. I guess it's dependent on the platform, but it's a goalkeeper for what he's doing the sound of my fender. ",4
1699,"It is hard to really describe what this pedal does, it is not distorted, flange, echo, or produces a choir. I heard it that it is described as the sound of your amplifier if someone had thrown a blanket from him.

Because happiness it would have, I acquired a trade and I have to admit that I agree with the entire euphemism blanket. This stompbox helps to correct the boxy sound from my Blues Jr. When placed at the end of my pedal grain - just before I encounter the amplifier. I do not feel that it runs on a dedicated effects to improve the tone of an amplifier, although I believe it works even better in a loop. I placed it in the securities loop of both a Palomino V8 (US / Ampeg) and a crate VC508 (a 5 watt USA made EL84 tube amplifier with Celestian Speaker) and it was transforming for both amps' tone (in a great way) . It does well with some rinsing. It is a pedal that I would leave all the time as soon as my tone has been called. I don't think it works when I walk my LP in a Jet City combo - especially when you try to coax subtle textures / harmonics. That amplifier also lacks a securities loop and I imagine that it would have a different effect as placed after the preamplifier phase. I suspect that it is rig dependent, but it is a goalkeeper for what it does with the sound of my mudguard. ",4
1700,"I will not explain about ""science"" behind how this pedal works. I'm just going to focus on how the pedal affects your tone. This is certainly not a boost and it's not an EQ, the Sonic Stomp's BBE is a single operating pedal. In the ear, it serves to add clarity, depth and body to your tone. Essentially, this pedal allows you to make the most of the tones of your amp already producing. The LO outline button ""increases"" the amount of bass produced by the amp. It is tightened rather and generally increases the depth of bass tone (and mid-medium). In the ear, it may seem at first like bass has been increased, but this is not the case. You have just heard all the bass tone that was there in the first place, which has been prepared when the signal has gone from your guitar to the amp. The process button really focuses on treble and high frequencies. These frequencies can often be very unpleasant and the removal of hearing, and the Sonic Stomp somehow and smooth these tones so that they are clearer and less difficult. This is not to say that you can not dial in highly aggressive and sharp ups if you play lead metal or something; Indeed, it will make these tones of lead MEARS even better. Now, I gave this 4 star product not because I had problems with that or that I was not badly satisfied; But rather because it's really a pretty subtle effect. At first, I could almost not say a difference between having it on and off. Over time, I have been able to better recognize and enjoy the impact it has on my tone, but it does not make a difference of ""night and day"". I recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you are happy with, and I just want to make it even better. This pedal will not make a solid state combo sounds of cheap 15 watts as a half-stack of tubes. This will not make you love your tone when you were completely dissatisfied with that before. At the conclusion, even if I certainly do not want to put this pedal in the category ""must have"", it definitely improves the quality of my tone. It's a pedal that I'm leaving all the time, because it improves clean and distorted tones. ",4
1701,"I'm not going to explain about the ""science"" behind how this pedal works. I focus this review on how the pedal influences your tone. This is absolutely no boost, and it is also not an EQ, the BBE Sonic Stomp is a unique functioning pedal. To the ear should add clarity, depth and body to your show. In essence, this pedal can get the most out of the tones that your amplifier already produces. The LO contour button ""increases"" the amount of bass produced by the AMP. On the contrary, it raises and generally increases the depth of the bass (and low center) tone. To the ear can initially sound like the bass has been raised, but it is not. You only hear the bass color that was in the first place that was seasoned when the signal went from your guitar to the amp. The process button really focuses on the treble and high mid-frequencies. These frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear, and the Sonic stub type like and smoothes those showing so that they are clearer and less hard. That is not to say that you cannot say in a number of very aggressive and cutting height that you cannot call you play lead metal or something; Indeed, it makes that sealing lead showing even better. Now I didn't give this product 4 stars because I have had problems with it or was not dissatisfied in any way; But rather because it is really a fairly subtle effect. In the beginning I could almost no difference between it on and off. With the time I have been able to improve the impact and appreciate that it has on my tone, but it doesn't make a ""night and day"" difference. I recommend this pedal to someone who has been a tone happy with, and just wants to make it even better. This pedal does not make a cheap 15-watt solid-state combo sound as a half-staple tube. It doesn't matter your tone if you are completely dissatisfied. In the conclusion, although I would absolutely not put this pedal in the ""must"" category, it absolutely improves the quality of my tone. This is a pedal that I leave all the time, because it improves both clean and distorted tones. ",4

Surprisingly, the drive control works progressively, allowing you to control the distortion a little with the control of the volume of guitar.

If you are considering using it as a practice amp and you do not move, I would recommend you to get a power supply (use the same pedals of most effects).
