"From Greg Abrams review, entitled ""everyone except snobbery"", the next comment on the product page: ""well, do you want a good (if a little"" basic "") distorted sound for less than $100? This is your deal."" I strongly object. You can find better distortion effects at a price of $100 or less, and even some distortion effects close to or lower than the DS-1's current price of $40. I've been playing the guitar for more than 10 years. Like many people, the pedal I first bought was the DS-1. After all, everyone is talking about them. They can be bought in any specific music store in the country. You heard that all these famous musicians are using them. In addition, DS-1 is actually quite cheap! So I robbed one like everyone else. You'll find that just because something is popular doesn't always mean it's good (see nickel, transformers, Kardashian family, etc.). So I plugged it in and didn't like it very much. Distortion is harsh, thin, artificial sound, always noisy. I have tried on both my amplifiers (my practical amplifier: solid-state fender frontman 25R and my large amplifier, B-52 at100, which is a 100W tube half stack) it is not very diverse, and I don't like the basic sound very much. I have read that the DS-1 made in Japan sounds better than the new model made in Taiwan, but in any case, the DS-1 is not a good pedal in my mind. But like many new players, I didn't know what was better. Fast forward a few years, I have bought and sold dozens of pedals. If you open your eyes, you will find that the whole world has great tones. So here are some pedals I currently have, which I like better than the DS-1. All of these are great universal distortions. It's easy to find new ones and use them in most guitar stores. At the time of writing this article, you can buy new ones for $75 or less on the good ol'amazon here. I started with ""big brother"" of DS-1 because I'm afraid that others think I'm a person who hates the boss (of course I'm not, I like TU-3, odb-3, MD-2, xt-2, etc.). This pedal has a better tone, not to mention two different distortion modes. The I setting is almost a higher quality DS-1, and the II setting is a brighter and richer tone. Since DS-1 is completely more popular than DS-2, you can find DS-2 on eBay at a very cheap price. A valuable pedal has unfortunately been ignored by many people. Pro Co Rat2: the pedal is very dirty. Maybe it's my personal favorite. In the past 30 years, you have heard that this box has been used in hundreds of songs. It is used by a large number of guitarists. This is a rich, full distortion that becomes slightly blurred at higher gain. I've never heard my bad voice. It's great to get a ""big amplifier"" sound from a small practice amplifier. It is also very suitable for pushing a large amplifier with too much clearance into the best position of super drive without turning the volume of the amplifier. A really good pedal. Ehx little big muff: big muff is another pedal you hear in hundreds of songs. It's a little fuzzy and distorted, but it must have its own range. Very large, saturated, warm. In the 1970s, it was widely used in the tone of classical rock music, and in the 1990s and later, it was used in a large number of garbage and garages. Everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to smashed pumpkin, little dinosaur and Jack White uses it. I personally recommend this small and large sleeve. Not only is its tone softer than that recently reissued in New York, it is smaller, uses an ordinary 9V adapter, and is cheaper! A great pedal. MXR distortion +: distortion + is a great first distortion that can usually be found very cheap. The advantage of distortion + is that it sounds great on any occasion, and the lack of tone knob helps to maintain its transparency, that is, you can hear the natural tone of guitar and amplifier more easily, and it won't cover your voice. Many celebrities have used it, including the great God of death Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhodes (Oz's famous guitarist) and sex pistol Band Steve Jones. DANELECTRO cm-1 cool cat metal: make sure you get cool cat metal, not metal II. It's a good pedal as well, but it's definitely more traditional metal pedal. Cool cat metal, or cm-1, is actually a very, very different pedal from most metal pedals. Basically, it's a preamplifier on the floor. It has a fully adjustable equalizer that can be adjusted into tons of volume and gain through the roof. So you can do anything from a clean enhancement (lowest gain, almost no coloring of the your tone) to a high gain metal material with the a lot of the super drive and rock tones in between. It works well with any amplifier I've tried, and you can find a lot of great sound. This is an incredibly versatile pedal, even a real bypass. Best of all, DANELECTRO seems to give way too much, so you can easily find a used or even new one for less than $30. A real hidden gem is actually cheaper than the DS-1. Joyo jf-03 crunch twist: this little guy surprised me. It is considered to be a clone of MI audio crunch box. If so, it must be a great pedal. It's essentially a Marshall pile in a box, boy, it's been successful. Huge creak, tons of volume and gain, it can really make your practice amplifier sound like a big pile of rags! It even sounds good in my modeling amplifier (few pedals can be used with my modeling amplifier, and this one is even better than the built-in Marshall simulation). You can buy a brand new one for $40, great! Speaking of Joyo, I bought some pedals and one or two pedals from Moen, another Chinese pedal manufacturer. I'm really surprised that their prices are frighteningly low (especially Moen Mo FM fuzzy moon, which honestly tells every big muff I've played). So Joyo and Moen, they have made all kinds of fluff, OD and dirt pedals that sound great. Look at them (before anyone starts to fully support a Chinese company, please remember that all pedals listed in my comments, including DS-1, are not made in the United States, let alone in the western hemisphere). I hope these suggestions will make you look forward to it. In addition, if you can't try pedals in the store, YouTube is a good place to hear demonstrations of different pedals. I should also mention that if you try to like DS-1 and it suits your needs, it will bring you more motivation. The tone is subjective. The sound of each pedal in different guitars and amplifiers is different, just because I may have different views on what you like, which doesn't matter. The main reason I post this lengthy comment is to give some information to novices. You have many options for deformable pedals. DS-1 is not the only product with reasonable price. Find something you really like and buy it. If it's the DS-1, one of the pedals I mentioned here, or anything else, it's important that it sounds right to you.",2

I read that the DS-1 made in Japan is better than the new model made in Taiwan, but in any case, the DS-1 is not a good pedal for me. But like many new players, I don't know what is the best.

All of these are a huge general variant that is easy to find and use in most guitar stores. At the time of writing, you can buy any new product here on the right ol'amazon for $75 or less. I started with ""big brother"" of DS-1 because I was worried that people would think I hated the boss (of course not, I like TU-3, odb-3, MD-2, xt-2, etc.).

Maybe this is my personal favorite. In the past 30 years, you have heard that this box has been used for hundreds of songs and used by many guitarists. This is a rich and sufficient distortion, which becomes a little blurred with the increase of income. Having a ""big amplifier"" sound from a small drive amplifier is great. It is also ideal for pushing an amplifier with too much clearance into the best driving position without turning the amplifier volume. A good pedal. Ehx shit: shit is another pedal you hear in hundreds of songs. A little fuzzy, a little distorted, but it must have its own scope. Very large, saturated, hot. It was widely used in classic rock music tones in the 1970s, garbage and garage in the 1990s and beyond. Everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmore to pumpkin crumbs, little dinosaurs and Jack White uses it. I personally recommend this small and large sleeve, not only because its tone is softer than the sleeve recently reissued in New York, it is smaller, uses an ordinary 9V adapter, and is cheaper! A good pedal. MXR distortion +: distortion + is a large first distortion and is often found to be very cheap. The advantage of transform + is that it can make a good sound in any situation. The lack of tone button helps to maintain its transparency, that is, you can more easily hear the natural tone of guitar and amplifier without masking your voice. Many celebrities use it, including the late Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhodes (Oz's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the sex pistol band. DANELECTRO cm-1 cool cat metal: make sure you get cool cat metal instead of metal II. It's also a good pedal, but it's definitely a more traditional metal pedal. Cool cat metal pedal, or cm-1, is actually a very different pedal from most metal pedals. Basically, it is a grounded preamplifier. It has a fully adjustable equalizer that can be adjusted into tons of volume and gain through the roof. So you can do anything from clean improvement (minimal gain, your voice has almost no color) to high gain metal materials, with a lot of super drives and rock tones in the middle. It works well with any amplifier I've tried, and you can find a lot of great sound. It's an incredibly versatile pedal, even a real bypass. The best thing is that DANELECTRO seems to leave too much space, so you can easily find an old one, even a new one, for less than $30. A real hidden gem is actually cheaper than the DS-1. Joyo jf-03 squeeze twist: this little guy surprised me. We think this is a clone of miaudiocrunchbox. If so, it should also be a good pedal. This is a pile of Marshall in a box, man. It works. The huge squeak, tons of volume and gain can really make your training amplifier sound like a lot of rags! It's even in my style amplifier (few pedals can be used with my style amplifier, and this one is even better than the built-in Marshall Music). You can buy a new one, $40, great! Speaking of Joyo, I bought some pedals and one or two pedals from Moen, another Chinese pedal manufacturer. I was really surprised at their low price (especially Moen Mo FM fuzzy moon, which honestly said every big groom I played). So Joey and moon, they all made all kinds of plush pedals, outer diameter and soil. It sounds good. Look at them. (before someone starts to fully support a Chinese company, please remember that all pedals listed in my comments, including DS-1, are not made in the United States, let alone in the western hemisphere) . I hope these suggestions can give you something to look forward to. In addition, if you can't try pedals in the store, YouTube is a good place to listen to various pedal demonstrations. I must also mention that if you want to like DS-1 and it meets your needs, it will give you a good opportunity to find what you want on a good website. Motivation reading. The tone is subjective, and the sound of each pedal varies according to the guitar and amplifier, just because I may have different views on what you like, which is not important. The main reason why I post this long comment is to inform beginners. You have a lot The houx and DS-1 with deformable pedals are not the only products with reasonable prices. Find what you really like and buy it. If it's DS-1, any pedal I mentioned here, or anything else, it's important that it sounds good to you.",2
"From Greg abblams reviews, for further ""tone tones"", make further checks on the pages of this product I strongly oppose. You can find better distortion for less than $100. I played guitar for more than 10 years. Many people were DS-1 for my first pedal purchase. After all, everyone talks about them, they are available in any music store in the country, you'll hear about all these famous musicians using them and DS-1 is actually pretty cheap! So I just tapped one like everyone else. Because something is popular, get to find it just because it doesn't mean that profit. So I plugged it and didn't really care about it. Distortion is always annoying with harsh, thin, artificial sounds. I tried it in my amplifier, my plastic amp: solid state fender frontman 25R, and my big amp, b-52at 100, which is a 100W tube half stack, it was not very diverse and The basic sound was not very touched to me. I made DS-1 sounds made in Taiwan models better than new sounds, but in either way, DS-1 is not just a great pedal in my mind. But like many new players, I didn't know anything better than that time. I sent him several years ago and sold dozens of pedals literally. The whole world of great tones is to find there if you open your eyes. So some pedals I now own very much like DS-1. All of them are easy to find great general-purpose distortion, easy to use in new and most guitar shops, and at this writing point, good ol ' Amazon can buy brand new brands below $75. I catch any flame from the people I think I hate boss. (I am certainly not, I start with TU-3, odb-3, MD-2, and xt-2, especially I DS-1's brother). This pedal does not mention two different distortion modes but has a much better tone to it. The i-set is pretty high quality DS-1, II setting is a bright, rich tone. Since DS-1 completely covers DS-2 popularity, you can find all DS-2 eBay at a very low price. A very valuable pedal, unfortunately overlooked. Pro Co Rat2: large dirty distortion pedal. Perhaps my personal preference. You have heard hundreds of songs in the past 30 years literally using this box, and is used with just a silly amount of that guitarist. With high gain, its rich, complete distortion gets slightly fuzzy. I have never heard of a bad tone. Its great for getting the ""big amp"" type of small practice amp sounds. Also great for pushing too many headrooms and large amp to overdrive suite spot without cranking the amplifier volume. Really excellent pedal. Ehx little big muff: big muff is another pedal that you've heard hundreds of songs. Its kind of fuzz, strain type, certainly owns its own sonic area. Very large, saturated and warm. 70s for classic rock tones is also used for the 90s and tons of grunge and garage. Used by smashing pumpkins, dinosaur juniors and Jack White guys from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour. I personally remembered little big muff, it's not only a touch cleaner in the tone than the recent New York reissue, its small, regular 9V adapter and its cheaper! Great pedal. MXR distortion +: distortion + is a great first distortion and can usually be found quite cheap. The good thing about distortion is that it sounds great to anything, and the lack of tone knobs helps to be somewhat transparent, i.e.you can easily listen to the natural tones of your guitar and amp; It does not cover on your instrument sound. Great companion is used by quite a few famous people including Jerry Garcia, Randall Rhodes (Ozzy's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of sex pistols. Danelectric cm-1 cool cat metal: make sure you get cool cat metal (not metal II). It is a fine pedal as well, but certainly a traditional metal pedal detail. Cool cat metal, or cm-1, is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals. Basically its front amplifier sitting on the floor. It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and increments through the roof. So you can do something from a high gain metal to a high gain metal one from many large overdrive and rock tones, with clean boost (with minimal gain, virtually no coloring to color). It works well with every amp I've tried it and can find tons of great sounds. Incredibly versatile pedal and its true bypass. The best part is Dan electro has made too many of them so it can be used easily or even under a new $30. True hidden gem that is actually cheap than DS-1. Joo jf-03 crunch distortion: this little guy surprised me. Maybe the clone of MI audio crunch box and if so, it should be one awesome pedal. Its essentially stuck on the marshal box and the boy succeeds to it. Tons of big crunches, volume and gain, it can really make your practice amplifier sound like a stack of big rugs! It also sounds in my modeling AMP (very few pedals well operated with my modeling amp, this one also has better sound than Marshall simualtion), and you can get a brand new one for $40, great, amazing! Speaking of Joyo, I had one or two of their pedals and one or two from the moron, a Chinese pedal maker, and I honestly, they were shockingly cheap (especially themoen Mo FM fuzz mooobe honestly honestly inspired by the sound given me every big muff I've ever played). Yo Yo and Moen, they check out both of the great sounds fuzz, OD, and dirt pedals, and various (and keep in mind that any of the pedals listed in my review, DS-1, before getting all of the arms about supporting Chinese companies, is done not only in the western hemisphere but in the US) Hopefully, if you can't try the pedals at the store, you can also try different pedals. If you can't try the pedals in the store, you can do another pedal If you match, I have to mention it. Tone is subjective, every pedal sounds different runs through different guitar and amp; and it's ok because I might share different opinions to something that you like My main reason to post reviews is to give you some information to the new players DS-1, one of the pedals I mentioned here or something else, is that it sounds right to you.",2
"From Greg Abrams'review, titled ""For Everyone Except Tone Nobs"", a review at the bottom of the page of this product: ""All right, so you want to get a good sound (if a little basic"") distortion for less than $100? This is your deal. ""I disagree. You can find many better distortions for $100 or less, even a few close or under the brand $40 the DS-1 is currently at price. I played guitar for more than ten years. Like many people, one of my first pedals was the DS-1. After all, everyone talks about them, they are available in any music store in the country, you feel of all these famous musicians who use them, plus a DS-1 is actually quite economical! So I took one like all the others. Come to find out that only because something is POPULAR, which does not always mean its good (see: Nickelback, the franchising of the Transformers, the Kardashian family, etc.). So I connected it and I didn't care. The distortion was harsh, subtle, artificial sound and always noisy. I tried it on both my amps (My practice amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, the B-52 AT100, which is a half tube of 100w) It was not very different, and the base sound was not very pleasant for me. I read that the Japanese ma d e the DS-1 better in sound than the most recent, made in Taiwan models but, in any case, the DS-1 is not a great pedal in my mind. But, like many new players, I d i d not know anything better at that time. A couple of years and I have There is a world of great tones to find out there if you keep your eyes open. Here are some pedals that I currently possess that I like much more than DS-1. All these are great general purpose distortions, easy enough to find new and used in most ch stores itarra, and can, at the time of this writing, be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good old Amazon. com, and are robust enough to last for years:Boss DS-2 Turbo Distorsion: to avoid getting flames from people who think I am a Boss hater (I'm not sure, I loved TU-3, ODB-3, MD-2, and XT-2, among others) I will start with the older brother of the DS-1. This pedal has a much nicer tone, not to mention two different ways of distortion. Setting I is a superior quality DS-1, setting II is a brighter and richer tone. Since the DS-1 completely obscures the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2 on ebay for pr Very cheap tools. A very worthy pedal, unfortunately neglected by many. Pro Co RAT2: Large pedal of dirty distortion. Probably my favorite. You have heard this box used literally on hundreds, if not thousands of songs in the last thirty years, used by a ridiculous amount of guitarists. It is a rich and pi distortion It is perfect to get a sound from a small amplifier. It is also great to push a big amp with too much head space into the hyper-pointed sweet spot without having to drive the volume of the amp. A really excellent pedal. The Big Muff is another pe It's a kind of confusion, a kind of distortion, but it certainly has its sonic territory. Very big, saturated and hot. Used heavily in the 70's for classic rock tones, even in the 1990s and beyond for tons of grunge and garage. Used by everyone by Carlos San tana and David Gilmour at Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White. I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff, not only is it a creamy touch in tone compared to the recent NYC reboot, its smallest, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEMARE! A great pedal. MXR Distorsion +: Distortion +: The Distortion + is a great before What is nice about Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything, and the lack of a tone knob helps to keep it a little transparent, that is you can more easily feel the natural tone of your guitar and amplifier, does not cover the sound of the equipment. by some famous people, including Greatfull Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoads (famous Ozzy guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols. Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal: Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT Metal II. It's also a nice pedal, but it's definitely more of a classic metal pedal. The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very different pedal than most metal pedals. Basically, it's a pre-amplifier which is located on the floor. It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and earn through the roof. So you can do anything from a clean push (with the gain to the minimum there is virtually no coloring to your tone) to get high metal stuff, with lots of exaggerations and rock tones in the middle. Works well with any amplifier I've tried, and you can find tons of fantastic sounds. It's an incredibly versatile pedal, and its real bypass. The best part is that Danelectro seems to have done too many of them, so you can do This little boy surprised me. He's supposed to be a clone o f the MI Audio Crunch Box, and if so, he must also be an impressive pedal. It's basically a stack of Marshall in a box, and the boy never gets to f great crunch, tons of volume and gain, can really make your amp practice feel like a big pile of spider! It also sounded good going into my amp model (very few pedals work well with my amp model, and this also Sounded better than the Marshall simualtion incorporated in) Speaking of Joyo, I had some of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN, another Chinese pedal, and I'm honestly impressed by how nice it sounds given their incredibly low price tag (especially the MO-FM Fum Moor who honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I've ever played through). So JOYO and MOEN, both make a variety of great fuzz sounds, or, and dirt pedals, check out (and before someone puts everything in their hands to support a Chinese society, please bear in mind that none of the pedals listed in my review, including DS-1, are made in America, let alone the western hemisphere) I hope these tips give you something to look for. Also, if you can't really try a pedal outside the store, YouTube is a great place to listen to demo s of what different pedals can do. I should also say that if you try to love DS-1 and adapt to your needs, more power for you. Tono is subjective, every pedal s different uona through different guitars and amplifications, and just because I can share different opinions about something that you love, okay. My main reason for posting this long review is to give the newest players some information. You have a lot of options for distortion pedals, the DS-1 is not the only thing out there If it's the DS-1, one of the pedals I mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right for you.",2
"From Greg Abrams review, titled ""For everyone except the to on snobs"", a review further on the page of this product: ""Good, so you want a good (as some""basis"") distortion sound for less than $100? This is your deal."" I beg to differ. You can do much better deformations for $100 or less, even a few nearby or under the $40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced. I've been playing guitar for ten years. Like many people, one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1. In the end, everyone talks about them, they are available in a certain music store in the country, you hear about all these famous musicians they use, plus a DS-1 is actually quite cheap! So I took one, just like everybody else. Find out that only because something is POPULAR, that does not always mean its GOD (see: Nickelback, the Transformers film franchise, the Kardashian family, etc.). So I plugged it in and I didn't really care. The distortion was hard, thin, artificial and always noisy. I tried it on both my amplifiers (My practice amplifier: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amplifier, the B-52 AT100, which is a 100-inch tube half stack) It was not very diverse, and the base sound was not very similar to me. I read that the Japanese DS-1's are better in sound than the newer ones, made in Taiwan models but, anyway, the DS-1 is just not a big pedal in my mind. But, like many newer players, I didn't know any better at the time. A few years ahead, and I literally bought and sold dozens of pedals. There's a whole world of grand displays to find when you keep your eyes open. Here are some pedals I now own that I like much better than the DS-1. They are all big general distortions, easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops, and can, at the time of writing, be purchased brand new for $75 or less here on the good old Amazon. com, and are robust enough to last for years:Boss DS-2 Turbo Disortion: should I not flame from people who think I am a Boss hater (I certainly am not, I loved the TU-3, the ODB-3, the MD-2, and the XT-2, among others) I will start with the big brother of DS-1. This pedal has a much nicer tone, not to mention two different deformation possibilities. The I-institution is almost a higher quality DS-1, the II-institution is a brighter, richer tone. If the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2's on ebay anywhere for very cheap prices. A very worthy pedal, unfortunately overlooked by many. Pro Co RAT2: Large dirty pedal deformation. Probably my personal favorite. You've heard that this box has been used on hundreds, if not thousands of numbers in the last thirty years, used by only a ridiculous amount of guitarists. It's a rich, complete distortion that gets a little fuzzy with higher profits. I've never heard a bad tone. It's great to get a ""big amplifier"" sound from a small exercise amplifier. It is also great for pushing a large amplifier with too much main space in the excessively sweet place without the pressure volume. A really excellent pedal. The Big Muff is another pedal you've heard on hundreds of numbers. It's a kind of donut, a kind of deformation, but it certainly has its own sonic range. Very large, saturated and warm. Heavy used in the'70s for classic rock shows, also in the'90s and further for tons of grunge and garage. Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White. I personally have the Little Big Muff, not only is it a little more creamy in tone than the recent NYC review, its smaller, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER! A great pedal. MXR Distortion +: The distortion + is a big first distortion, and can usually be found quite cheap. What is nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on everything, and the lack of a tone button helps it to keep it somewhat transparent, i.e. you can more easily the natural tone of your guitar and amplifier, it does not cover over your equipment sound. Used by a number of famous people, including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoades (Ozzy's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols. Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal: Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, not the Metal II. That's also a nice pedal, but it's definitely more of a traditional metal pedal. The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very different pedal than most metal pedals. It's a pre-amp that's on the floor. It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and profits from the roof. So you can do anything from a clean boost (with the profit at least there is almost NO color on your tone) to win high metal things, with numerous large exaggerations and rock shows between. It works well with every amp I've tried, and you can find tons of great sounds. It's an incredibly versatile pedal, and it's even true bypass. The best thing is, Danelectro seems to have made far too much of it, so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30. A real hidden gem that's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1. Joyo JF-03 Crunch Disortion: This little boy surprised me. It would be a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box, and if so, it would also have to be a great pedal. It's basically a stack of Marshall in a box, and boy will make it one day succeed in that. Big crash, tons of volume and profit, it really can sound your practice amplifier like a big ragin'stack! It even sounded good in my model pump (very few pedals work well with my model work amplifier, and this one sounded even better than the Marshall simulation built in), and you can send a brand new one for $40, fantastic! Speaking of Joyo, I've had some of their pedals, just like one or two of MOEN, another Chinese pedal maker, and I'm honestly impressed by how beautiful they sound given their shockingly low price card (especially the MOEN-FM Fuzz Moozz that honestly out of Big Muffs every Big Muff I've ever played). So JOYO and MOEN, they both make a variety of big sounding boxes, od, and dirty pedals, check them out (and before someone in the arms about supporting a Chinese company, consider that none of the pedals mentioned in my assessment, DS-1 included, are made in America, let alone the western hemisphere). Hopefully these suggestions will give you something to look for. Even if you can't really try a pedal in the store, YouTube is a great place to hear demo s of what different pedals can do. I should also mention that if you try to love the DS-1 and it suits your needs, then more power for you. Tone is subjective, each pedal sounds different through different guitars and amplifiers, and just because I can share different opinions about something you love, that's okay. My main reason for publishing this long review is to give newer players some information. You have plenty of options for distortion drop, the DS-1 is not the only one that is affordable. Find something you really love and buy it. If it's the DS-1, one of the pedals I mentioned here, or anything else, it's important that it sounds good to you.",2
"From Greg Abram's review, titled ""For All But The Tone Nobs"", a review further down on the page of this product: ""Good, so you want to get a good (if anything""basic"") distortion sound for less than $100? That's your deal."" I beg to differ. Much better distortions for $100 or less, even some close to or below the $40 brand for which the DS-1 is currently cheap. I played guitar for over ten years. How many people was one of my first Pedal purchases of the DS-1. In addition, each of them says they are available in every music store in the nation, you hear from all the famous musicians they use, and a DS-1 is actually quite cheap!

Pro Co RAT2: Large dirty distortion pedal. Probably my favorite. You have heard that in the last thirty years this box has been used literally hundreds, if not thousands, of songs used by a ridiculous number of guitarists. It is a rich, full distortion that becomes slightly blurred with higher profits. I've never heard a bad sound from mine. It's ideal to get a ""big amplifier"" sound from a small exercise amplifier. It is also ideal to push a large amplifier with too much headroom into the Overdriven Sweet Spot without turning the amplifier volume. A really excellent pedal. EHX Little Big Muff: The Big Muff is another pedal you have heard in hundreds of songs. It's some kind of fuzz, some kind of distortion, but it definitely has its own sound range. Very large, saturated and warm. Heavy in the 70s for classical rock tones, also in the 90s and beyond for tons of grunge and garage. Used by everyone, from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White. Personally I welcome the Little Big Muff, it is not only a little more creamy in tone than the new NYC rice sauce, its smaller, uses a normal 9v adapter and its CHEAPER! Great pedal. MXR distortion +: The distortion + is a big first distortion and can usually be found quite cheaply. What's nice about the distortion is that it sounds good on everything, an d the lack of a sound button helps to keep it a little transparent, i.e. you can easily hear the natural sound of your guitar and amplifier, it does not cover over your equipment sound.

Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal: Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT the Metal II. It is also a fine pedal, but definitely more a traditional metal pedal. The Cool Cat Metal or CM-1 is actually a completely different pedal than most metal pedals. It's a preamplifier sitting on the floor. It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume to win through the roof. So you can do everything from a clean push (with the gain at the minimum there is virtually NO coloring up to your tone) to high-gain metal stuff, with lots of big overtime and rock tones in between. It works well with every amp I've tried, and you can find tons of great sounds. It is an incredibly versatile pedal and even its real bypass. The best part is, Danelectro seems to have done far too many of them, so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30. A real hidden gem that is actually CHEAPER as a DS-1. This little guy surprised me. It's supposed to be a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box, and if so, it must be a great pedal. It's basically a Marshall Stack in a box, and boy never makes it in one. Large Crunch, tons of volume and profit, it can really make your practice amplifier sound like a big Ragin'Stack! It even sounded good in my modeling amplifier (very few pedals work well with my modeling amplifier, and this sounded even better than the Marshall simulation built in), and you can get a whole new one delivered for $40, fantastic!

I hope these proposals will give you something to look for. Besides, if you're not really trying to get a pedal out of the shop, YouTube is a good place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.

"The next comment on the product page from Greg Abrams review is: ""yes, so do you want a good (if basic) spiritual voice for less than $100? This is your deal."" Yes. I strongly object. You can find better error effects in the price of $100 or less, and even find error effects in the current price of DS-1 close to $40 or lower. I've been playing the guitar for more than ten years. Like many people, the pedal I bought for the first time was DS-1. Anyway, everyone is talking about them. They can buy it at any specific music store in the country. You've heard that all famous musicians are using them, and you've heard that DS-1 is actually quite cheap. So I robbed one like everyone else It's just that some things are very popular, and you'll find that it's not always good. (such as nickel currency, transformers series films, kadeshan family, etc.) so it's inserted. Not much. The truth is harsh, thin, man-made voice, always noisy. I've tried both of my amplifiers. (my practical amplifier: solid mud film frontman 25R and my large amplifier, B-52 at100, which is a 100W tube ointment) it is not diverse, and I don't like the basic sound very much. I've read that the DS-1 made in Japan sounds better than the new model made in Taiwan, but anyway, the DS-1 is not a good springboard for me. But like many new players, I didn't know what was better. For nearly a few years, I have bought and sold dozens of pedals. If you open your eyes, you will find that there are good tones all over the world. So here is my current pedal. I like it better than DS-1. All these are great universal studios. It's easy to find new things and use them in most other places. When writing the text, you can buy new things for $75 or less in the good ol ""Amazon"" here. Starting from the ""big brother"" of DS-1, I'm afraid I think I hate the boss (of course I'm not, but I like TU-3, odb-3, MD-2, xt-2, etc.). This pedal has a better tone, not to mention two different distortion modes. The I setting is almost higher quality DS-1, and the II setting is brighter and richer tones. Because DS-1 completely exceeds DS-2, you can find DS-2 in innovation. The price is very cheap. Unfortunately, the very valuable pedal Pro co rat 2 ignored by many people: the pedal is very dirty. Maybe it's my personal favorite In the past 30 years, you have heard that this box is used for hundreds of thousands of songs, and a large number of guitarists are using it. This is a rich and sufficient mistake, which is a little vague in higher interests. I've never heard ill of me. It's great to get the sound of a big amplifier from a small practice amplifier. It is also suitable for pushing the large amplifier with too much precision to the best position of super drive without turning the volume of the amplifier. Really good springboard ehx little big muff: big muff is another springboard heard in hundreds of songs. It's a little fuzzy and a little unreal, but it must have its own range. It is very large, saturated and warm. It was widely used in classical colors in the 1970s and in garbage and garages in the 1990s and later. Anyone can use it, from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to ""broken pumpkins"", little dinosaurs and Jack White. I personally recommend this small big plug. This is not only softer than the colors recently reissued in New York, but also smaller and cheaper. Very good pedal MXR real matrix +: real matrix + is the great first real matrix, which is usually found to be very cheap. The advantage of real array + is that it sounds good in any case, and the lack of tone switch helps to maintain transparency. In other words, it is easy to hear the natural tone of the guitar and amplifier without masking the sound. Many celebrities have used the great envoys Jeremiah, Randy Ross (Oz's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the holy pistol band. DANELECTRO cm-1 cooling cat metal: make sure to cool cat metal instead of metal II. This is a good pedal, but it must be a more traditional metal pedal. Cold cat metal or cm-1 is actually a very different pedal on most metal pedals. Basically, it's a preamplifier on the floor. It has a complete balancing device that can adjust the volume and benefits of tons through the roof. So you have a lot of super drive and rock tones, from clean enhancement (lowest gain, almost no coloring) to high gain metal materials. It matches any amplifier I've tried. You can find a lot of good sound. It's an incredibly versatile pedal, even a real fork in the road. It's better that Denise Trow gives way too much. The price of used and even new ones is less than $30. In fact, hidden gems are cheaper than DS-1. Zoe jf-03: this guy scared me. It is considered to be a copy of MI audio crunch box. If so, it must be a good springboard. It's essentially a Marshall pile in a box. Boy, successful. With the huge creak, volume and gain per ton, it can really make your practice amplifier sound like a pile of big cloth! It even sounds good in my modeling amplifier. (it's rare that the pedal can be used with my modeling amplifier, but it's even better than the built-in Marshall simulation.) You can buy a new one for forty dollars. That's great. Speaking of Zoe, I bought pedals and one or two pedals from Moen, another Chinese pedal manufacturer. I'm really surprised that their prices are frighteningly low. (in particular, Mon mo-fm fuzzy moon frankly tells all the big muffs I've played.) Therefore, joy and Moen have made all kinds of nice wool, OD and pedals. Look at that. (before anyone fully supports Chinese companies, all pedals listed in my comments are not made in the United States, including DS-1, so there is no irony.) I hope these suggestions will make you look forward to it. In addition, if the store can't try the pedal, YouTube is a good place to hear other pedal demonstrations. I would also like to mention that if you like DS-1 and meet your requirements, it will bring you more motivation. The tone is subjective. Different guitars and amplifiers with different pedals sound different. It's just that I have different views on what you like, so it doesn't matter. The main reason for my lengthy comment is to provide some information to novices. You have many options for variable pedals. DS-1 is the only product with unreasonable price Find something you really like. If it's DS-1, one of the pedals I mentioned here, or anything else, it's important that it can hear you accurately.",2
"Greg Abrams's comment is entitled ""all tones except snobbish tones"", and the following comment on the product page: ""well, do you want a good (if a little"" basic "") distorted sound for less than $100? This is your deal."" I strongly object. You can find better distortion at a price of $100 or less, or even at a price of $40 close to or below the current price of the DS-1. I've been playing the guitar for more than 10 years. Like many people, the first pedal I bought was the DS-1. After all, everyone is talking about them. They are in any music store in the country. You heard that all these famous musicians are using them. DS-1 is really cheap! So I stole one like everyone else. You'll find that just because something is popular doesn't always mean it's good (see nickel, transformers, Kardashian, etc.). So I plug in the power. I don't like it very much. Distortion is a sharp, thin, artificial sound that is always noisy. I tested my two amplifiers (my practical amplifier: fender solid-state front-end 25R and my large amplifier, B-52 at100, which is a 100 watt tube stack). I don't like the basic sound very much. I read that the DS-1 made in Japan sounds better than the new model made in Taiwan, but anyway, the DS-1 is not a good pedal in my mind. But like many new players, I don't know what's better. Over the years, I have bought and sold dozens of pedals. If you open your eyes, you will find that the world has a big shadow. So here are some pedals that I currently have, and I prefer it to the DS-1. All these are very large generic distortions that are easy to find and use in most guitar stores. At the time of writing, you can buy them at good ol'amazon for $75 or less. I started with the ""big brother"" of DS-1 because I was afraid that people would think I hated my boss (of course not, I like TU-3, odb-3, MD-2, xt-2, etc.). This pedal has a better tone, not to mention two different distortion modes. Setting I is almost a higher quality DS-1, and setting II is a brighter and richer tone. Because DS-1 is more popular than DS-2, you can find DS-2 on eBay at a very cheap price. A very valuable pedal, unfortunately, has been ignored by many people. Pro Co Rat2: the pedal is too dirty. Maybe it's my personal favorite. In the past 30 years, you have heard that this box has been used for hundreds of songs and used by many guitarists. This is a rich and complete distortion, which becomes slightly blurred with the increase of profit. I never heard my voice. It's great to have a ""big amplifier"" sound from a small practice amplifier. It is also ideal to drive a large amplifier with too much free space to the optimal position without rotating the volume of the amplifier. A really good pedal. The big sleeve is another pedal, and you can hear hundreds of songs. It's a little fuzzy and distorted, but it must have its own scope. Very large, saturated, warm. In the 1970s, a large number of classical rock tones were used, and in the 1990s and after, a large number of garbage and garages were used. From Carlos Santana and David Gilmore to crushed pumpkins, little dinosaurs and Jack White, everyone uses it. Personally, I recommend this small large sleeve not only because it has a softer tone than the recent New York redistribution, but also because it is smaller and cheaper to use a normal 9V adapter! Big pedal. MXR distortion +: distortion + is a large first distortion that can often be found very cheap. The advantage of distortion + is that it sounds great on any occasion, and the lack of a tone button helps to maintain transparency, that is, you can more easily hear the natural tone of the guitar and amplifier, which can't hide your voice. Many celebrities have done so, including the great God of death Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhodes (the famous oz guitarist) and Steve Jones of the sex pistol company. DANELECTRO cm-1 cool cat metal: make sure you get cool cat metal, not metal II. This is also a good pedal, but it must be more traditional than metal pedal. Cool cat metal pedal, or cm-1, is actually a very, very different from most metal pedals. Basically, it is a ground preamplifier. It has a fully adjustable equalizer that can be adjusted to tons of volume and gain through the ceiling. So you can do anything from a clean upgrade (minimum gain, your tone has almost no color) to a high gain metal material with a lot of super drive and rock tones in the middle. It works with any amplifier you've tested, and you can find a lot of great sound. This is an incredibly versatile pedal and even a real bypass. Most importantly, DANELECTRO seems to have taken too many steps. You can easily find an old or even new one for less than $30. Real hidden gems are actually cheaper than DS-1. This little guy surprised me. It is considered a clone of my audio compact box, and if it is, it must be a great pedal. It's basically a pile of Marshall in a box, boy, he's been successful. The huge squeak, tons of volume and gain really make your practice amplifier sound like a pile of rags! It even sounds good in my style amplifier (few pedals work with my style amplifier, which is even better than Marshall integration). You can buy a new $40, great! Speaking of Joyo, I bought some pedals and one or two from Moen, another Chinese pedal manufacturer. I'm really surprised that they are very cheap (especially Moen Mo FM fuzzy moon, which honestly tells about every great dumbbell I've played). So joio and moon, they all made all kinds of lint pedals, OD and dirt. It sounds great. Look at them. (before someone starts supporting a Chinese company, please remember that all pedals listed in my comments, including DS-1, are not made in the United States, let alone in the Western Hemisphere.) I hope these suggestions will keep you waiting. In addition, if you can't try pedals in stores, YouTube is a good place to listen to different pedal demonstrations. I must also mention that if you want to like the DS-1 and adapt to your needs, it will give you more power. The tone is subjective. Each pedal has different sounds on different guitars and amplifiers, just because I have different views on what you like. The main reason for my long comment is to provide information to novices. You have many options for deformable pedals. DS-1 is not the only product with reasonable price. Find something you really like and buy it. Whether it's the DS-1, one of the pedals I mentioned here, or anything else, the important thing is that it sounds right for you.",2
"From Greg Abrams'review entitled ""For everyone except tone snobs"", a review further down the page of this product:""All right, so do you want to get a good (if a little""basic"") distortion sound for less than $100? This is your business."" I disagree. You can find much better distortions for $100 or less, even some close to or under brand $40 the DS-1 is currently expensive. I've been playing guitar for over ten years. Like many people, one of my first purchases was the DS-1. After all, everyone talks about them, they are available at any given music store in the nation, you hear about all these famous musicians using them, plus one DS-1 is really cheap! So I busted one just like everybody else. Come find out that just because something is POPULAR, which does not always mean your BO (see: Nickelback, the Transformers film franchise, the Kardashian family, etc.). So I called and I didn't like it very much. The distortion was hard, thin, artificial, sounding and always noisy. I tried on both my amps (My practical amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, the B-52 AT100, which is a halfstack 100th tube) was not very diverse, and the basic sound was not very similar to me. I read that the Japanese DS-1 is better in sound than the newest, made in Taiwanese models, but, anyway, the DS-1 is not a big pedal in my mind. But like many younger players, I didn't know anything at the time. It advanced a few years and I bought and sold literally dozens of pedals. There's a whole world of big tones to be discovered out there if you keep your eyes open. So here are some pedals that I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1. All of them are big distortions of general purpose, easy to find new and used in most guitar stores, and can, at the time of this writing, be bought new ones for $75 or less here on good old Amazon. With, and are rough enough to last years:Head DS-2 Turbo Distortion: To not catch any flames of people who think I am a boss hater (I certainly am not, I loved TU-3, ODB-3, MD-2, and XT-2, among others) I will start with DS-1's older brother. This pedal has a much nicer tone for it, not to mention two distinct modes of distortion. The I setting is much more DS-1 quality, the II setting is a brighter and richer tone. As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2 across the ebay for very cheap prices. A very dignified pedal, sadly neglected by many. Co-RAT2: Big dirty distortion pedal. Probably my favorite. You've heard this box used in literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last thirty years, it's used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists. It is a rich and complete distortion that in higher gains it is slightly blurred. I've never heard a bad tone out of mine. It's great to get a ""big amplifier"" kind of sound from a little practice amplifier. It is also large to push a large amp with a lot of head space to the overloaded sweet point without having to rotate the amplification volume. An excellent pedal. The Big Muff is another pedal you've heard on hundreds of songs. It's a kind of confusion, a kind of distortion, but it definitely has its own sonic territory. Very large, saturated and hot. Used heavily in 70s for classic rock tones, also in the 90's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage. Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White. I, personally, reccomend the Little Big Muff, not only is it a little more creamy in tone than the recent NYC reissue, its minor, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER! A big pedal. MXR+ distortion: The distortion +is a great first distortion, and can usually be found very cheap. What is good about the Distortion +that looks great in anything, and the lack of a tone button helps to keep it a little transparent, i.e. you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp, it does not cover the sound of your equipment. Used by some famous people, including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoads (Ozzy's famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols. Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal: Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT Metal II. It's a thin pedal, too, but it's definitely more of a traditional metal pedal. The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very different pedal to most metal pedals. Basically, it's a pre-amp that sits on the floor. It's got a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof. So you can do anything from a clean boost (with gain at least there is virtually no coloring NO to its tone) to gain high metal material, with plenty of big rock tones in the middle. It works well with any amplifier I've tried, and you can find tons of great sounds. It's an incredibly versatile pedal, and its same true bypass. The best part is, Danelectro seems to have done a lot of them, so you can easily find one used or even new to under $30. A real hidden gem that is actually CHEAPER than an DS-1. This little guy surprised me. It's supposed to be an MI Audio Crunch Box clone, and if so, it must be an amazing pedal too. It's essentially a pile of Marshall in a box, and boy he always succeeds at that. Big crush, tons of volume and gain, it really can make your practice amplifier sound like a big pile of rags! Even sounded good going into my modeling amplifier (very few pedals work well with my modeling amplifier, and this even sounded better than the Marshall similarity built in), and you can get a new brand for $40 shipped, fantastic! Speaking of Joyo, I had some pedals as well as one or two of MOEN, another Chinese pedaller, and I'm honestly overwhelmed by how good they sound due to their surprisingly low price tag (especially the MOEN MO-FM Fuzz Mooz Fuzz that honestly outside Big Muffs every Big Muff I've ever touched through). So JOYO and MOEN, both make a variety of large sound felt, od, and ground pedals, check them (and before anyone stands up in arms about supporting a Chinese company, please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review, DS-1 included, are made in America, much less the Western hemisphere). I hope these suggestions will give you something to look for. Also, if you can't really try to pedal out in the shop, YouTube is a great place to listen to demos of what different pedals can do. I should also mention that if you try to love DS-1 and it suits your needs, rather than more power for you. Tone is subjective, each pedal sounds different going through different guitars and amplifiers, and s.o. because I can share different opinions about something you love, okay. My main reason for posting this long review is to give new players some information. You have a lot of options for distortion pedals, the DS-1 is not the only thing out there that is accessible. Find something you really love and buy it. If it's the DS-1, one of the pedals I mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to YOU.",2
"From a review by Greg and Abrams, titled ""For All Except Tone Snots"", a review further on the page of this product: ""All right, so you want to get a good (if a little""basic"") distortive sound for less than $100? That's your deal."" I totally disagree. You can find much better distortions for $100 or less, even a few close or under $40 DS-1 is currently valued. I've been playing guitar for over ten years, and like many others, one of my first gay purchases was DS-1. Besides, everyone's talking about them, they're available in every music store in the country, you hear about all the famous musicians who use them, plus DS-1 is pretty cheap! So I made one, just like everybody else. Learning that just because something is POPULAR does not always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback, Transformers French film, Kardashian family, etc.). So I plugged him in, and I didn't care about him. The distortions were sharp, thin, artificial and always noisy. I tried it on both amplifiers (My practical amplifier: solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, B-52 AT100, which is 100-tube) was not very varied and the basic sound was not very nice to me. I read that the Japanese DS-1 with a better sound than the newer ones, made in Taiwanese models, but either way, the DS-1 is not the best faggot in my head. But like many newer players, I knew nothing better. Spend a few years, and I bought and sold literally dozens of faggots. There's a whole world of great sounds that you can find there if your eyes are open. Here are some pedals that I currently have that I like much more than DS-1. All of them are great distortions of general purpose, easy to find ne w and used in most guitar shops, and can, during this writing, be bought completely new for $75 or less here on the good old Amazon. Com, and with it strong enough to survive for years:Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion: So that I don't catch any flames from people who think I'm against Bossa (I'm certainly not, I love TU-3, ODB-3, MD-2, and XT-2, etc.) I'll start with DS-1's older brother. This pedal has a much nicer tone, not to mention two different modes of distortion. Settings I are of higher quality DS-1, Settings II is lighter, richer tone. Because DS-1 completely eclipses the popularity of DS-2, you can find DS-2 all over ebay at very cheap prices. A very valuable faggot, unfortunately overlooked by many. For each RAT2: The great pedal of deformation. Probably my favorite. You've heard that this box would be used on hundreds, if not thousands of songs in the last thirties, used by a ridiculous number of guitarists, a rich, full-bodied deformity that, with greater profits, is a little fuzzy. I've never heard a bad tone from mine. It's great to get a ""big amp"" kind of sound from a small training amplifier. It is also great to push a large amplifier with too much headgear into a sweet spot without having to turn the volume amp. Really great faggot. EHX Little Big Muff: The Big Muff is another faggot you've heard in hundreds of songs. It's kind of fluffy, kind of deformed, but it definitely has its own sound territory. Very large, saturated and warm. Used heavily in the 1970s for classic rock sounds, also in the 1990s and beyond for tons of grunge and garage. Used by everyone, from Carlos Santana and David Gilmore to Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White. I personally invite Little Big Muff again and, not only is he slightly more creamy in color than the latest version of New York, his smaller, uses a regular 9v adapter and his CHEAPER! Great faggot. MXR Disortion +: The Disortion + is a great first deformation and can usually be found quite cheaply. What's nice about deflecting + is that it sounds great on everything, and the lack of a tone loop helps keep it a little transparent, i.e. It is easier to hear the natural t he his guitar and amp, it does not cover your sound devices. Used by several famous people, including Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia, Randy Rhoads (famous guitar player Ozzy) and Steve Jones from Sex Pistols. Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal: Make sure you get Cool Cat Metal, NOT Metal II. He's also a good faggot, but definitely a more traditional metal faggot. The Cool Cat Metal, CM-1, is actually a very different pedal than most metal pedals. Basically, it's a pre-amp that sits on the floor. It has a fully regulated EQ with tons of volume and is picked up through the roof. So you can do everything, from clean to charging (with profit to the minimum there is practically NO hue to tone) to high strengthening metal things, with a lot of overhauls and rock in the meantime. It works well with every amplifier I've ever tried, and you can find tons of great sounds. The best part is that Danelectro seems to have to o many, so you can easily find one used or even new under $30. A real hidden gem that's cheaper than DS-1. That little guy surprised me. They say it's an MI clone Audio Crunch Box, and if it is, it must be a great faggot, too. Basically, Marshall's holding on to the box, and the boy has ever succeeded. Great crisps, tons of volume and growth, can really make your training amplifier sound like a big, slutty pile! It even sounded good going to my amp modeling (very few queers work well with my amp modeling, and this even sounded better than Marshall's simualtion built in), and you get a whole new one for the $40 sent, fantastic! Speaking of Joyo, I had several of their faggots, as well as one or two from MOEN, another Chinese faggot manufacturer, and frankly I'm shocked at h o w nice they sound, given the shockingly low price (especially MO MO-FM Moozz, w h o frankly challenges the Big Muffs of every Big Muff I've ever played) Yeah. So JOYO and MOEN, both create different great-sounding fuzz, from, and dirty faggots, check them out (and before anyone stands in the arms of supporting the Chinese company, please remember that NONE of the faggots mentioned in my review, DS-1 in general, are made in America, not to mention the western hemisphere). I hope these suggestions will give you something to look for. In addition, if you can't actually try pedals in the store, YouTube is a great place to hear a demo of what different pedals can do. I should also mention that if you try and love DS-1 and it suits your needs, it's more power for you. Tone is subjective, every faggot sounds different running through different guitars and amps, and just because I can share different opinions about something you love, it's okay. My main reason for publishing this long review is to provide some information to newer players. You have a lot of options for deformation pedals, DS-1 is not the only thing available. Find something you really love and buy it. If this is DS-1, one of the faggots I mentioned here, or anything else, it's important that it sounds good to you.",2

"I am very disappointed with the quality and engineering of this product. The solutions to the main problems are after the review. In order of importance, the defects bothering me are: 1) quality: very weak soft metal screws. With minimal force and well aligned drives, all four screw heads I used had some damage. Two of them were rounded too much. I was worried that it would be difficult to remove them in the future, which led me to go to the hardware store to find higher quality replacement screws. 2) Engineering: it is recommended to use in the manual. The screw (the screw provided with straplock) is designed for No. 2 cross screwdriver. However, the standard #2 driver is too large to fit into the belt button. Therefore, you may have to choose between grinding the screwdriver to install or use #1, because this is a wrong tool, which will increase the impact of the first problem above. 3) Project: the connection point of the strap is 5 / 8 inch away from the guitar. The belt button has a radius of approximately 3 / 16 of an inch. Therefore, as the lever pulls the screw outward, any transverse stress (i.e. guitar weight) will be amplified by more than three times. A 9-pound guitar exerts a constant force of 27 to 30 pounds on the screws and the wood around it (of course, half the force when the weight is evenly distributed between the two belt buttons). If you are a little more active on the stage, the level of power may be higher. In fact, if these screws are not nonsense, it may be a three-star or four-star comment. Once you solve the problem of inappropriate ordinary screwdriver and install the screwdriver correctly, it may be suitable for most people. Therefore, if you have been using one set, I suggest you: go to the hardware store to buy #6 x 1 ""oval head stainless steel replacement screws. Please note that these screws cannot be installed correctly, but they are the best match and can be modified. (in my local store, each one is 21 cents. Dunlop's batch cost may be 10 cents higher than the garbage screws they bought for this dress.) Put the screw into the electric drill (with the tip facing inward) Therefore, when you operate the drill bit, the screw head can rotate smoothly. Use a file or belt sander to remove a small part of the drill bit diameter from the screw head. This does not require much. I use the belt sander, which takes about 20 seconds at a time. During operation, file down a cheap No. 2 screwdriver to install it into the belt buckle. Installation is the same as ordinary screws Discuss your friends to try different brands!",2
"I am very disappointed with the quality and engineering of this product. The solutions to the main problems are discussed.

"I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product. Jobs around key issues follow reviews. Defects that bother me for importance are: 1) quality: very weak soft metal screws. Using minimum power and well aligned drivers, there were some damage to all four screw heads I worked on. Two of them were afraid that they would be hard to remove later. And I ran to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws. 2) Engineering: recommended for formulations and screws (come with strap Cox) 1. However, the standard ankle 2 driver is too big to fit the strap button. So you will need to choose either grinding a suitable screw driver, or one count 1 to increase the impact of the first problem above because it is a wrong tool for work. 3) Engineering: the point of the connection of the strap is one fifth of the inch from the guitar. Strap button has 1 inch radius of approximately 3 / 16 ths. Therefore, any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is also enlarged by more than 3x. A 9 pound guitar will apply a constant 27 to 30 pound force to the screw and its surrounding wood. Get too active on stage and the level of power goes high. In reality, this could have been a three or four star review if the screw was not a full clap. It will probably work for most people once dealing with the fact that a normal driver does not fit and gets properly installed. Here's what I recommend if you're stuck in a set: go to the hardware store and get six ?? 1. (it is 21 cents in my local store, and 10 cents in the Dunlop will be ten cents more than you paid for the crap screws that come with it.) The screw is put into the electric drill (point end) so that the screw head rotates smoothly when using the screw head. After removing the screw head, drill and use the belt sander to perform the drill as usual, with your new screw, your friends try another brand!",2
"I was very disappointed both in the quality and the engineering of this product. Work on the main issue follows the review. The defects that annoy me in order of meaning are:1) Quality: Very weak screws in soft metal. Using minimal force and a well-aligned driver, there's been damage to the heads on all four I've worked with. 2 of them rounded up so much that I feared they would be difficult to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store for superior quality replacement screws. 2) Engineering: The instructions recommend, and the screws (those that come with the straplock) are designed for a screwdriver \35; 2 Phillips. However, a standard driver is too big to fit the belt buttons. So it is likely that you have to choose between grinding a screwdriver to adapt, or using one that will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job. 3) Engineering: The connection point for the belt is 5/8th of one thumb out of the guitar. The belt button has a radius of about three/16th of a thumb. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. guitar weight) is amplified by more than 3x due to the lever pulling outwards on the screws. A nine pound guitar would apply a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screws and on the wood around it (half that when the weight is evenly distributed on two buttons of the belt of course). A little too active on stage and the power level could go a lot higher. Realistically, if the screws weren't all bullshit, it could have been a three or four-star review. When faced with the fact that a normal screwdriver does not fit and things are installed properly, it would probably work for most people. So, if you're stuck with a set, here's what I suggest:Go to a hardware store and buy x 1""screws to replace stainless steel ovale-head. Note that it doesn't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (It's 21st cents each in my local shops, and it would cost Dunlop maybe ten cents more in bulk than they paid for the crappy screws that come with it.) Put the screw in an electric drill (end point in) So the head spins without hitches when you use the drill. Execute the drill while using a file or a Sander to take a fraction of the diameter from the head to bolts. It doesn't need much. I used a tape sander and it took about twenty seconds each. While you are there, file a cheap screwdriver so install with the new screws as normal, and recommend your friends to try a different brand!",2
"I was very disappointed in both the quality and the technique of this product. After the assessment, a work-around will follow for the most important issue. The defects that disturb me in order of importance are:1) Quality: Very weak screws of soft metal. With minimal power and a well-aligned driver, there was some damage to the screwheads on all four I worked with. Two of them rounded up so much that I was afraid they would be difficult to remove later, making me go to the hardware store for a higher quality replacement screws. 2) Engineering: The instructions recommend, and the screws (screws that come with the straps) are designed for a \35;2 Phillips screwdriver. However, a standard \driver is too big to fit into the belt buttons. So you will probably have to choose between grinding a screwdriver to fit, or using a \35; 1 that will increase the impact of the first problem above, because it is the wrong tool for the job. 3) Engineering: The connection point for the belt is 5/8th of one centimeter away from the guitar. The belt knob has a radius of three/16th centimeter. Therefore, any lateral tension (i.e. the weight of the guitar) is increased by more than 3x due to the leverage that pulls the screw out. A 9-pound guitar would have a constant 27 to 30-pound force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is evenly distributed on two belt buttons of course). A little too active on stage and the power level can go much higher. Realistically, if the screws weren't completely worthless, this would have been a 3-or 4-star assessment. Once you get the fact that a normal screwdriver doesn't fit and things are properly installed, it would probably work for most people. So if you're stuck with a set, this is what I suggest:Go to an hardware store and buy \35; 6 x 1""Oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. Note that these will not fit well, but they are the closest match and can be changed.

A 9-pound guitar would have a constant 27 to 30 pound force on the screw and the wood around it (half if the weight is evenly distributed on two belt buttons naturally). A little too active on stage and the strength could go a lot higher. Realistically speaking, if the screws weren't total crap, it might have been a 3- or 4-star rating. Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver doesn't fit and installs things properly, it would probably work for most people. So if you are stuck with a set, I recommend the following: Go to an hardware store and buy Operand6x 1""oval stainless steel screws. Note that they do not fit properly, but they do fit the closest and can be modified. (They are 21-cents each in my local shops, and Dunlop might have cost ten cents more than what they paid for the fucking screws that go with it.) Insert the screw into an electric drill (tip in end) so the screw head spins smoothly when you operate the drill. Guide the drill while you use a file or a belt grinder to take a fraction of the diameter from the screw head. It doesn't take much. I used a belt grinder and it took about twenty seconds each. You are about to install a cheap'352;driver so that it fits into the belt screwdriver. Install with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!",2
"I was very disappointed in both the quality and the mechanics of this product. The review follows an approach to the main issue. The deficiencies that concern me in a number of important ways are:1) Quality: very weak soft metal nails. Using minimal force and a well-aligned driver, there was some damage to the screwheads on all four I worked with. Two of them are rounded so much that I was afraid it would be difficult to remove later, challenging me to run to the hardware store for a higher level of spare screws. 2) Engineering: The instructions are recommended, and the screws (those coming with the straps) are designed for a d35,2 Phillips screw. However, a standard driver 352 is too big to fit on the strap buttons. So, it's possible that you have to choose between screwing a screwdriver to fit, or using an air351 that will increase the effect of the first problem above, since it's the wrong tool for the job. 3) Engineering: The connection point of the strap is 5/8th of an inch outside the guitar. The strap button has a radius of about three/16th of an inch. Therefore, any lateral pressure (i.e. guitar weight) is increased by more than 3x due to the leverage pulling the screw outwards. One guitar of nine kilos would apply 27 to 30 pounds of force to the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is evenly distributed to two belt buttons, of course). If you get a little more active on stage, the power level can go a lot higher. Realistically, if the screws weren't completely screwed up, this could be a 3 or 4-star review. Once you face the fact that a normal screwdriver doesn't fit and install things properly, it'll probably work for most people. So if you get stuck with a set, what I'm suggesting is go to a hardware store and buy 356 x 1'oval stainless steel screws. Note that these do not match properly, but are the closest match and can be modified. (It's a 21-cent each in my local stores, and it would cost maybe ten cents more in bulk than they paid for the crappy screws that come with it.) Put the screw in an electric drill so the screw head rotates smoothly when you handle the drill. Run the drill with a file or triangle of a belt to remove a fraction of the diameter from the screw head. It doesn't take much. I used a belt triangle and it took about twenty seconds each. While you're at it, enter a cheap screwdriver 352. With the new screws as normal, and I recommend your friends try a different brand!",2
"I am very disappointed with the quality and engineering of the product. The solutions to the main problems remain to be reviewed. The disadvantages that afflict me in order of importance are as follows. 1) Quality: very weak screw in alchemy. I used a driver that matched the minimum power and slightly damaged the four screws I used. Two of them are rounded too much and may be difficult to remove in the future, so we went to the hardware store to find higher quality screws. 2) project: the manual recommends that the screws (straplock and the provided screws) be designed as No. 2 cross screws. However, the standard #2 driver is too large to fit on the belt button. Therefore, you may need to grind the screwdriver flat, install or use #1. This is a wrong tool, which may increase the impact of the first problem above. 3) item: the connection point distance of the tape is 5 / 8 inch. The buckle has a radius of approximately 3 / 16 of an inch. Therefore, as the lever pulls the screw outward, the transverse stress (i.e. other weight) increases by more than three times. A 9-pound guitar gives 27 to 30 pounds of high energy to the screw and its surrounding trees. If you are more active on the stage, the level of power will be higher. In fact, if these screws are not empty words, they may also be three-star or four-star comments. First of all, solve the problem that the general driver is inappropriate, and install the driver correctly, which can be applied to most people. Therefore, if you continue to use one set, I suggest you buy #6x1 ""oval head stainless steel replacement screws from the hardware store. These screws can not be installed correctly, but they are the most consistent, so they can be modified. (at stores in our area, each one costs 21 cents. Dunlov's bulk cost will be 10 cents higher than the garbage screws they bought for this dress.) Put the screw on the drill bit (point inward) Therefore, when the drill is operated, the screw can rotate stably. It doesn't take much to remove part of the drill diameter from the screw with rope or belt grinding wheel. I use belt grinding wheel, which takes about 20 seconds each time. During the operation, In order to install on the seat belt buckle, use cheap No. 2 screw. Please install. Like ordinary screws, it is recommended that your friends try other brands!",2
"I am very disappointed with the quality and engineering of this product. Solutions to the main problems are discussed below. Importantly, the defects bothering me are: 1) quality: very weak soft metal screws. The four screws I used are a little damaged. Two of them were too round. I was worried that it would be difficult to remove them in the future, which prompted me to go to the hardware store to find higher quality replacement screws. Engineering: the instruction manual recommends the use of screws designed for No. 2 cross screwdriver (screws supplied with straplock). However, the standard controller #2 is too large to fit on the seat belt button. Therefore, you may need to adjust the screwdriver when installing or using #1, because this is a wrong tool, thus increasing the impact of the previous problem. Engineering: the belt connection point is 5 / 8 inches away from the guitar. The belt button has a radius of approximately 3 / 16 inch. Therefore, any lateral force (i.e. the weight of the guitar) will be amplified more than three times because the lever pulls the screw outward. A 9-pound guitar exerts a constant force of 27 to 30 pounds on the screws and the surrounding wood (of course, this is half the force when the weight is evenly distributed between the two buckles). If you are more active on the stage, your power level may be higher. In fact, if these screws are not nonsense, it may be three or four-star comments. Once you solve the problem of inappropriate and incorrect installation of ordinary screwdriver, it can work for most people. So if you've been wearing suits, I suggest you go to the hardware store and buy 6 x 1 ""Stainless steel oval head replacement screw. Please note that these screws cannot be installed correctly, but they are the most compatible and can be modified. At my local store, 21 cents per dress, Dunlop's batch may be 10 cents more than the garbage screws they bought for the dress. Place the screw on the electric drill (tip inward) so that the screw head rotates smoothly when you operate the drill. Remove a small part of the drill bit diameter from the screw head with a file or abrasive tape. It doesn't need much. I use a belt sander. It takes about 20 seconds at a time. During the operation, file a cheap No. 2 screwdriver on the belt buckle. Install it like ordinary screws. It is recommended that your friends try different brands!",2
"I am disappointed with the quality and engineering of this product. The main solution is that the quality of metal screws is very poor. With the smallest hard drive and all four screws, I used a small damage. There were too many women. I was worried that it would be difficult to separate them in the future, so I went to the hardware store to find quality. For the improved engineering screw, it is recommended to use the screw used with the linked list, which is designed as a 2-number cross screwdriver. However, the standard driver is too large to install on the belt. So you have to install or use the wrong drugs, so add The guitar front connecting strap has a 5-8 inch impact. The buckle radius is 3-16 about an inch. Therefore, the thermal stress of the guitar is tripled due to transverse tension. 27-30 fixed tension guitar Pound the screw and half around it when the weight is evenly fixed to the two buckles. On stage, and to a higher level. In fact, if these constellations are not absurd, it can be three or four-star views. When you deal with inappropriate problems and install them correctly, it can be applied to most people. So if you receive a set of suggestions, you can go to the hardware store and buy it. You need to replace the stainless steel. In my local store, everyone is 21 cents and may be more expensive than the garbage they buy clothes. Screw So when you use a screwdriver, you can use a file or a small diameter drill to rotate. From this thread, not too much. I use a list of each folder for about twenty seconds. 2?? Communicate with ordinary people, introduce your friends and try different brands.",2
"I'm disappointed with the product quality and engineering. After the review, the main issues were discussed. In order of importance, my shortcomings are: 1) quality: the metal screws are too soft and weak. Using minimal strength and good drive alignment, all four screws I used were some damaged. These two are too close. I'm afraid it will be difficult to get them in the future, so I went to the hardware store to find a higher quality replacement screw. 2) Engineering: it is indicated to use the screw designed for 2 cross screwdriver (screw with locking block). However, the standard Taber 2 driver is too large to install the belt button. Therefore, you may have to choose honing screwdriver when installing or using TAP1, because it is an incorrect tool, which increases the impact of the first problem above. (3) Geometry: connect one point of the strap to the 8.5 Inch of the guitar. The buckle diameter is approximately 1 inch 3 / 16. Therefore, any transverse stress (i.e. guitar weight) can be amplified more than three times because the lever pulls the screw outward. The 9-pound guitar exerts 27 to 30 pounds of force and is fixed around the screws and wood (of course, half the force when the weight is evenly distributed between the two buckles). If you are a little more active on the stage, you may have a higher level of power. In fact, if these nails are not nonsense, it may be a three-star or four-star comment.

During the operation, the next file No. 2 screwdriver is cheap to adapt to the installation of the belt buckle. Like ordinary screws, it is recommended that your friends try Different brands!",2
"I am very disappointed with the quality and design of this product. Address the main issues reviewed. In order of importance, the disadvantages I worry about are: 1) quality: very weak soft metal screws. With minimal power and steering wheel alignment, all four screwdrivers I used were damaged. Two of them were too round. I was worried that it would be difficult to remove them in the future. So I took me to a hardware store to find better quality to replace the screws. 2) Design: it is recommended to use the instruction manual, which is designed as cross screwdriver No. 2. However, the standard \ \ \ \ 350V driver is too large to install on the belt button. Therefore, you may need to choose to install or use \ \ 351t between grinding screwdrivers, because this is a wrong tool, which will increase the effect of the first problem. 3) Design: the belt connection point is 5 / 8 inches from the guitar. The belt button has a radius of approximately 3 / 16 inch. Therefore, any transverse stress (i.e. guitar weight) will increase more than three times because the lever stretches the screw outward. The 9-pound guitar will be stretched onto a screw and wound around a tree with a constant force of 27-30 pounds (of course, when the weight is evenly distributed between the two belt buttons, the force is half) (laughs) If you are a little active on the stage, your strength level may be higher. In fact, if these screwdrivers are not outright nonsense, it may be three or four star comments. Once you solve the problem of ordinary screwdriver and install the screwdriver correctly, it can come in handy for most people.

"I was very disappointed with the quality and engineering of this product. The next item is a review of a working round on the main issue. The flaws that bother me in order of meaning are: 1) Quality: very weak soft metal bolts. Using minimal force and a well-aligned driver... There's been some damage to the screw heads of all four I've worked with. Two of them rounded up so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later, making me run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws. 2) Engineering: The instructions recommend, and the screws (those that com e with straps) are designed for a Louis35 screwdriver; 2 Phillips.

So you probably have to choose between grinding a screwdriver to fit, or using a \Josep 35; 1 that increases the impact of the first problem above, since it is the wrong tool for the job. 3) Engineering: The connection point for the strap is 5/8th of an inch off the guitar. The strap button has a radius about three/16th of an inch. Therefore, any and any stress and side (i.e. guitar weight) is magnified by more than 3x due to leveraging pulling out on the screw. A 9-kilo guitar would apply a constant 27 to thirty kilos of force to the bolt and the wood around it (half when the weight is evenly distributed on two strap buttons, of course). Get a little too active onstage and the power level could go a lot higher. Realistically, if the screws weren't total crap, this could have been a three-star or four-star overhaul. Since you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver will not fit and get things properly installed, it would probably work for most people.

"I was very disappointed in both the quality and the engineering of this product. After the review, the main issue is circumvented. The defects that concern me in order of importance are:1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws. Using minimal force and a well-positioned driver, the entire 4th I've worked with has suffered some screwdriver damage. Two of them circled so much that I was afraid they'd be hard to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store with higher-quality spare screws. 2) Engineering: Instructions are recommended, and screws (those that come from traps) are designed for screwdriving ""2o352 Phillips. However, the standard \community 352 driver is too big to fit in the bar buttons.

The tape button has a radius of about three/16th an inch. Therefore, any lateral stresses (i.e. guitar weight) are increased by more than 3x due to the drawbar lever outside the screw. A 9-pound guitar would put a solid 27 to thirty kilograms of force on the screw and wood around it (half as much when the weight is evenly distributed and on two belt buttons of course). A little too active on stage, and the power level could go a lot higher. Realistically, if the screws weren't total bullshit, it would be a 3-or 4-star review. When you deal with the fact that an ordinary screwdriver won't fit and install things properly, most people probably will.

The space required to add rotating objects actually means that it is useless to put plane tools on the table. I didn't even know there was a puller in this thing. Look at him...

After I decide whether to stick to this brand, or go back to the super slinky'supdate 3/25well another month passed (a week ago) and the D string broke the same way allowing me to believe that I have faulty strings these strings are not as good as they say. He's gonna lose another star anyway. If this happens with another set of strings, I will review my guitar/review and change accordingly",2
"I bought some strings of elixir for immortality as my acoustic instrument. I'm very satisfied. However, for my stratt, these strings didn't sound good from the beginning. About a week later, I really began to wonder whether it was in my mind or whether I really didn't have the support I thought I usually got from a new pair of strings. I'm sure these strings caused all my problems. I'm right. I put a pair of D'Addario XL 9.5 (highly recommended for players who can't decide whether 9 seconds or 10 seconds). I was surprised at how much timbre and support these immortality strings have lost to me. I do think I can easily move up and down the blackboard with these strings, but the lack of support and tone forces me to stay away from these strings forever.

These are not high-quality strings at all, but cheap high-quality strings made in China. They are acceptable for people who don't play often, but if you play every day or as a performer, avoid using these strings. Better strings are worth the extra cost. In fact, you don't have to replace them as often as you use these cheap strings, saving money. I have this problem with all strings of D'Addario brand, whether electric guitar or acoustic guitar, 6-string or 12 string guitar. During tuning or playback, the thinner gauge will break. Discoloration and corrosion usually contaminate the friction strip and keep the neck dirty at all times. Cleaning after each performance will only make the strings corrode faster.",2

Add it to the winding separating on the FRET bar exposing the internal solid string, and the string touches the ""flat"" sound. These are not quality strings, just cheap Chinese quality. They are OK for those who don't play frequently, but play daily or avoid these strings as performers. Better strings are worth the extra cost. Save money by not having to replace them frequently as you actually do with these cheap strings. I have had this problem for all Dudley object strings for electricity or acoustics.

I have problems with all the D'Addario tunes, whether it's electric guitar or acoustic guitar, 6-string or 12 string guitar. During adjustment or playback, a thin line may be torn.

"It was bought on the advice of others. I have a cable with a standard Neutrik / Switchcraft type end, but due to the use of pressure, the cable should be strain free or just designed for long life. It worked well in about 4-6 months, and then it broke down. It happened so fast (the trad type seems to take longer), I swear it must be the output jack on my guitar. After confirming that the guitar was ok, I tried a shorter cable and the effect was very good. D'Addario does offer lifetime replacement, but it makes you a little embarrassed - while waiting for replacement, you need a spare cable, and you must pay the return freight of the defective cable at your own expense. You must also take away all R.A., which makes it a deal breaker. These additional costs make this cable as expensive as those with years of use records. In my case, I clenched my teeth, did what I should do in the first round and got a very good dimazio cable. Again, this kind of cable sounds good at work - the capacitance of a longer cable may be a problem. The good news is that the high price of IMO does not guarantee that any cable sounds good. Alternative DiMarzio is another example that ranks high in the cable comparison list. I didn't enter the magic spell or invisible aspect, and usually find that someone will pay more for the cable, but I hope the durability and published capacitance are within a certain range. This one meets half of these criteria, but it becomes expensive because it may fail sooner or later. Well, the price is higher than the cable with higher initial price but longer service life. So the replacement sent to me by planet waves is now a backup and is still in the original packaging. I think when replacing the main cable, I will only use it for a short time, so in this case, it should be able to use it for a long time. If I have a few dollars in freight and D'Addario is still under the lifetime warranty, I may replace it if / when the second one is damaged. More likely, I will write it down in my study class and throw it away. Even the $4 freight is equivalent to a considerable percentage of the cost of more durable cables - at IMO, it should be set aside to fund the final replacement. If this cable can be used for 1.5 to 2 years, considering the price, I may give it 5 stars. If D'Addario takes away the warranty, it may change the customer's view of what the price should be, because it is a worn thing, simple and clear. How much is the R & D cost of idk; It's worth investing in something at this price point, but that's what I want - a realistically acceptable trouble free life without warranty as a compromise. This will not make it a deal breaker.",2
"It was bought on the advice of others. I have a standard Neutrik / Switchcraft type one-end cable, but due to the use pressure, the cable should be deformation free or designed only to prolong the service life. It ran for about 4-6 months and then broke down. It happened so fast (the type of transaction seems to take longer), I swear it's my guitar problem. After confirming that the guitar was ok, I tried a short cable and it worked well. D'Addario offers lifelong replacement, but it makes you a little embarrassed: before replacement, you need a spare cable, and you must return the defective cable at your own expense. You have to tear down all the R.A., which makes him a market destroyer. These additional costs make this cable as expensive as those used for many years. In my case, I clenched my teeth and did the first lap I should do. I got a very good dimazio cable. Similarly, this cable looks good, and the capacity of a longer cable may be a problem. The good news is that the high price of IMO does not guarantee that cable TV sounds good. Alternative DiMarzio is another example of a cable comparison list. I don't have access to magic or intangible aspects. I usually find that someone pays more for cables, but I want durability and publishing ability to some extent. This standard is half, but it becomes expensive because it will fail sooner or later. Well, the price is more expensive than before, but the cable with longer service life is higher. So another option given to me by planetary wave is now backup, still the original packaging. I think I will only use the main cable for a short time, so in this case, it should be available for a long time. If I have a few dollars for shipping and dadario is still under the lifetime warranty, I can replace it when the second damage occurs. More likely, I will put it in my class and throw it away. Even the $4 transportation cost accounts for a large part of the cost of more durable cables - at IMO, it should be retained to fund the final replacement. If this cable can last 1.5 to 2 years, considering the price, I can give it 5 stars. If D'Addario accepts the warranty, it can change the customer's view of what the price should be, because it is a shabby and simple thing. How much is idk? It's worth investing at this price, but that's what I want - an almost acceptable problem-free life cycle, no guarantee of compromise. This does not make him a market destroyer.",2
"This was bought on the advice of others. I had a cable that the edge of the standard Neutrik / Switchcraft type failed me, and this cable was to be simply designed for freedom or for long life because of the weight of the use. It worked for about 4-6 months and broken. It was so fast (the trad type seemed to be long) it must have been the output jack of my guitar. After confirming that the guitar is OK, I tried a shorter cable that worked fine. D 'Addario provides a lifetime replacement, but it puts you a bit Bitten - you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement and You have to pay back shipping of defective cables from your pocket. R. You must get a fully taken, this becomes a contract breaker. Extra costs make this cable expensive as it has essentially a track record that lasts years. In my case I bitten the bullet and did what I had to do the first attempt round and got a really good DiMarzio cable. Again, this cable will sound well while it works - the capacitance on longer cables can be a problem. Good news is that IMO's high price is not a good cable sound guarantee. Exchange DiMarzio is another example at the top of the cable comparison list. I don't go into the mojo or intangible dimensions to find someone paying a lot for the cable, but I want the durability or announced the capacitance in a certain range. This one meets half of those criteria but it becomes more expensive due to the possibility of failing sooner or later. Well expensive, first higher price relative to longevity cable long. So the replacement the planet wave has sent me back now and still in the original packaging. I will use it for a short period while replacing my main cable. If I have a couple of dollars for shipment number and d 'Addario, I'm honored with a lifetime guarantee. The more I just choke it into the learning lessons and throw it. Further, $4 shipment is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable. If this cable is from the last 1.5 years to two years, I would probably give it five stars given the price. And if dadagio has removed the guarantor, it will probably reshape customer's perception of what something at this price should be cost. Idk how much research and development it is worth their trouble to put something at this price point, but that's what I shoot. It doesn't make it a trading breaker.",2

I tried a short line and it worked well. D'Addario does offer lifelong replacement, but it puts you in a dilemma: you need a spare cable while waiting for replacement, And you must pay the cost of returning the defective cable at your own expense You should also go to the R.A. these additional costs lead to the cost of this cable as high as the cost of the cable, It's been registered for years.

Dimazio's replacement is another example of ranking first in the cable comparison list. I don't enter the spell or the invisible side. I usually find that someone pays more for the cable, but I hope the patience and capacity will be revealed within a certain limit. This half meets these criteria, but it becomes expensive because it will fail sooner or later. Well, compared with the original price, but the cable life is longer and the price is higher. Therefore, the replacement sent to me by planetary wave is now backed up and retained in the original package. I think when replacing the main cable, I will only use it for a short time, so in this case, it must be suitable for durability. If I have a few dollars in freight and D'Addario is still working on a lifetime guarantee, I can replace it if it is damaged the second time. I'll probably write it in class and throw it away. Even $4 freight is a good price. The United States would represent a significant proportion of the cost of longer cables - which IMO should retain to finance subsequent replacement.

After confirming the guitar was good, I tried a shorter cable, which worked fine. D'Addario's offering a lifelong replacement, but it's gonna put you in a bit of a pickle. You need a back up cable while you wait for a replacement, and you have to pay the return return of the defective cable out of pocket. You also have to let the R.A. take it all, this makes it a quitter. The extra costs make this cable essentially as expensive as something that takes years.

After I confirmed that the guitar was okay, I tried a shorter cable that worked well. D'Addario offers a lifelong exchange, but it puts you in a little bind-- you need a backup cable while you wait for a replacement, and you have to pay for the return of the defective cable from your pocket. You also have to have R.A. taken completely, which makes it a breach of contract. The additional costs make this cable essentially as expensive as something that has a long tradition for years.

After I confirmed that the guitar was okay, I tried a smaller wire, which worked fine. D'Addario offers a substitute for life, but he puts you on a little commitment... You need a backup cable while you're waiting for a replacement, and you have to pay for the return of the defective cable out of your pocket.

The replacement Planet Waves sent me is now the backup, and it's still in the original package. I figured I'd just use it for a short time, replace my main cable, so it'll last a long time in this condition.

It cannot be ""true deviation"" as long as the signal travels through a pot, but they can use pots that are virtually short when adjusted correctly and with the pedal forward. Anyway, the difference between hooking my guitar directly to the amplifier and putting this pedal in the chain between the amplifier is immediately noticeable. The tone becomes softer, the output drops. I would expect that from an Asian knock-off, not an A-list gear maker. I may be asserting Ernie Ball's reputation, even though they make good guitars, I must say, and I've used their strings for many years. If you're planning on using this EB-6180 pedal with digital effects, you should be fine. This is because the digital device will take two measures of pure resistance at each end of the rock. Signal processing takes place in the unit, not on the pedal. It occurs to me that any pedal with a buffer (NOT ""true bypass"" in other words) can solve this problem a, which is more than likely related to impedance, such as a tuner pedal, between the guitar and the volume pedal. I'm gonna have to try this, but it doesn't excuse Ernie Ball from his responsibility. Major FAIL on their part. 2 stars are generous because EB does not honor the simple principle ""first do no harm"". Hurts your tone. How stupid is that? The pedal itself is very attractive, it seems indestructible, although I have my doubts about their ""rope"" mechanism over time. The rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the ground. I have no recommendations for a volume pedal.

"If you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in guitar configuration > Volume Pedal > Amp (putting effect pedals anywhere you want), it is a pedal modified by POORLY. It can't be ""real bypass"" as long as the signal travels through the potentiometer, but they can use pots that are virtually short when properly set and with the pedal forward. In any case, the difference between putting the guitar directly into the amplifier and putting the pedal in the chain between the ampoule is immediately noticeable. The sound gets boring, the exit falls. I was expecting this from an Asian knock-off, not from the best equipment manufacturer. Maybe I'm exaggerating Ernie Ball's reputation, but they've been making great guitars and I've been using their strings for years. If you're planning to use the EB-6180 pedal with digital effects, that should be good. This is because the digital device performs two measurements of pure resistance at both ends of the rocket. Signal processing is done in a unit, not a pedal. (These units have their own sound problems, but this is another review.) It seems to me that any faggot with a buffer (NOT ""real bypass"" in other words) can solve this problem, which is more than likely related to impedance, such as a tuner pedal and, between the guitar and the loudspeaker pedal. I have to try, but that doesn't excuse Ernie Ball from their responsibility. Major FAIL on their side. Two stars are generous, because the EB does not follow the simple ""do no harm"" principle. It's bad for your tone. Isn't that silly? The pedal itself is very attractive, seems indestructible, although over time I have doubts about their string mechanism.

"Suitable for cheap beginners to sit down and practice with a belt. This is the first time I bought a guitar belt. I really don't care about quality. I just need a tape. In the six months since I owned it, I took it off my electric guitar and put it on a new electric acoustic guitar I recently bought. It has been exploding. It's a question of standing at a concert or just near your home. The guitar can withstand a fatal dive, and a dive may not cause too much damage, some may break their necks or worse.

Over 6 months Ive had, I took off my electric guitar and put it on the new electroacoustic I got recently, and it keeps jumping. This is a problem that's just standing in the gig or around your home. On the other hand, one dive may take too much damage that may crack some neck or bad guitar, and can take a dive of that death. My advice: spend alittle to get the whole time, leather strap unless you plan to sit and play (you really need a strap anyway).

After playing with the device for a few minutes, I noticed that every move, whether I keep the receiver and transmitter still and moved into my home, or just the transmitter seriously affects the quality of the receiver. Even the length of the microphone line, whether balanced or simply collected around the transmitter, had an adverse effect on the quality of the output sound. Yeah. Perhaps because of the competitive signal received from another source, which I described earlier. I'm afraid that would not be a very useful and reliable device for my purposes.",2

"Dampit was recommended to me by a guitar coach a few years ago. I have used the standard model for some time. It seems a bit tricky to let it hold enough water to wet the guitar, but still let it dry enough to have absolutely zero drops of water inside the instrument. I used to hang it next to the clip, let it drip for about 15 minutes, and then put it in the guitar. Later, I tried the humidipak humidifier. To help them recharge on fearlessness, I put it in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a sealable top, press the side to saturate it, then roll it up in the planet waves microfiber polishing cloth, and press the end of the cloth to soak it. Then unfold the rag, place it under the spindle box, a drop of water just enters the hard shell box, then roll up the end of the polishing cloth, cover the wet end with dry material, and push it into the sound hole above humidipak. Well done. So I ordered a super damping for my new product, and I intend to do the same. They don't ship with clips now. The company said it had too many complaints about scratches, and although I didn't seem to have a problem, they didn't intend to risk a costly new acquisition. More importantly, there should be a sponge to absorb the water in the pipe. When I press the side of the pipe, it is empty. So I sent it back to Amazon for a refund. There is no problem with the refund, but I started from dampit and tried to insert a sponge into the planet waves to avoid water dripping on the guitar or damaging the sound effect.

"A few years ago, a guitar coach recommended dampit to me. I have been using the standard model for some time. Keep enough water to wet the guitar, but keep it dry enough to make it absolutely free of water droplets in paperwork, which seems a bit tricky. I used to hang it next to the clip, let it drip for about 15 minutes, and then put it in the guitar. Later, I tried to use the humidipak humidifier. In order to help them charge without fear, I put it in a one gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a waterproof top, press both sides to saturate it, Then I rolled it on a planetary wave microfiber polishing cloth and soaked it at the end of the cloth. Then, unfold the rag, place it under the spindle housing, just drop a drop of water into the hard housing, then roll the end of the polishing cloth, cover the wet end with dry material, and push it into the sound hole above humidipak.

"Dampit was previously recommended to me by a guitar instructor and I used the standard model for some time. It seemed tricky to get enough to hold the water enough to humidify the guitar, but it still gets completely dry with a zero drip in the instrument. I hung it with a clip and dried it for about 15 minutes while doing other things before putting it on the guitar. Then I tried humidipak humidifier and wound up to help recharge them in the Dreadnought, I put Damm in the gallon plastic bag with distilled water and resealable top, then pushed it to the side to saturate it, then rolled it in the microwave polished cloth cloth of the wave Pressing on the edge of the cloth took it to dig it. Then spread the cloth and place the Damm hole under the headstock that the water drop will enter into the hard shell case, then wrap the edge of the polishing cloth to cover the damp edge with dry material and press it against the sound hole over the damp hole. He worked great. So I ordered super dampit to do the same for my new 000 acoustic plan. They now ship without a clip. Companies say they have too many complaints about scratch. More importantly, it was the sponge that absorbs water inside the tube, and it was empty when pressed against the side of the tube. So I sent it to Amazon for refund. There is no problem getting the refund, but I'm moving from dampit, trying to insert the planet wave using the sponge that has eliminated the chance of dripping the guitar drops or has damaged the finish.

I used to hang it from the clip and let it dry for about fifteen minutes while I did other things before I put it on the guitar. Later I tried Humidipak's humidifiers and to load them into a Dreadnoxot, I went to put Damppit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a movable cap, pressing the sides to saturate it, and then wrapping it in a fabric of Planet Waves Microfires and pushing at the end of the fabric to mold it. Then unwrap the cloth, put the moisture under the mantle, where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell casing, and then roll the end of the stirring fabric to cover the liquid tip with dry material and push it into the sound hole above the liquids.

"I ordered one of them because I like my other planet waves capo very much (I believe it is an old metal version of this, not &#34; Lite & #34;).

You prefer to play on thin strings Hi 3... very nice, resonant and clean... What kind of metal trash with the other three that's supposed to be bass strings, I don't know... Just as someone else noted that the sound transition from nylon to nylon's conductive wound is GIGANTIC. This makes the movement from D to G string too noticeable CANT THE OVE MAKE 6 strings that sound similar to the same guitar, even? That sounds like two different nerds... It sucks. oohthanks man",2

"This one may be closer to a $150 guitar. It fits and finishes well, but in the end it's like most Chinese made guitars. Judging from the comments, I really hope this is a great gem worth $200, but I'm not impressed at all. One thing that bothers me is that these guys produce everything from guitars to snowmobiles - which usually means they're a know it all, but they're not proficient at all. I recently bought a Johnson & Johnson jg-610-n, a Johnson & Johnson jg-620-n, a Bristol bd-16, a jasmine S35 and this Yamaha. If I only play the Yamaha guitar, I might think it's a pretty good guitar, but I've tried all this side by side, and I'm sure it's not surprising at all. Bristol blew it out of the water not only because it was $50 cheaper, but also because it had better sound. Johnson guitars have a little higher action, not much higher, and a cheaper fit and finish. Jasmine is very good, but I haven't spent enough time playing it to give a real comment. Yamaha fg700gs looks absolutely neat and has a good midsole, but it doesn't have a good impulse from high-end to low-end. Now, its bottom is a little wider, so it has more body, but the overall range is not very good. In contrast, Bristol has high prices and many low prices. In addition, the boards on the jahama guitar feel a little thick, although they look similar next to other guitars. I can't help thinking that the comments here are a little ""honeycomb thinking"", and everyone is hyping it. Maybe I have a useless guitar, but I doubt they are all made in the same factory.",2

From the review, I really wanted this to be some great jewelry for only $200, but I'm not impressed at all. One thing that annoys me is that these people are jet skis to make everything from guitar. I recently bought Johnson jg-610 n n, Johnson jg-620 n, Bristol bd-16, jasmine S35 and this Yamaha. I think maybe it's a pretty good guitar if I only play Yamaha, but I've definitely tried all of these side-by-side, I can certainly say it's not quite surprising. Bristol blows this thing from the water and it plays just because it's just $50 cheaper and better. Johnson guitar has both a little higher action (not much of height) and cheaper fit and finish. Jasmine is good but I don't spend enough time to play it to give a real review. The Yamaha fg700gs are neat and neat and have a decent mid, but really don't have great high to low end punches. Now it's pretty wide at the bottom, but the overall sound range is not large as it has a bit more body. Bristol has a large height and a lot of deep lows. The fretboard also looked like it next to the other guitars but felt a bit more bit on the sheet pile. Here's a review that nobody can help to be a bit of ""bub mind"" to buy hype.

If I only play guitar at the foot of the mountain, I may think it's a pretty good guitar, but I've tried all this nearby. I can say it's not surprising. Bristol threw it out of the water, not only because it was $50 cheaper, but also because it was effective. All Johnson guitars have a slightly higher level, not too high, and a cheap dress and finish. Jasmine plays well, but I don't have enough time to make real comments. Yamaha fg700gs looks absolutely neat and has a good midsole, but in fact there is no good pulse from top to bottom. So, its lower part is a little wider, so it has more body, but the whole range is not very good. In contrast, the price in Bristol is very high and the price is very low.

Bristol soaked the toy out of the water because it was $50 cheaper and had a better sound effect. Johnson's guitar is not too high and matches the cheaper guitar. Jasmine is OK, but I don't have enough time to make a real comment on it. The appearance of YAMAH fg700gs is absolutely simple, and the medium and low prices are good, but in fact, the power from high level to low level is not good. Now the floor is a little wide and the body is more, but the overall range is not good. In contrast, Bristol has many high and low prices.

This is more a user problem than a manufacturing problem. If you want to isolate a frequency range, increase that range and then cut the previous ones and after it and you will have a narrow range. In this respect, it's like an MXR 6 band.",2

"Total acoustic sound &#34; well;, But the sound is strange. I gave it back. Compared with the alternatives on the market, its price seems to be high. Advantages - the boss housing is metal, the mechanical design is durable - the standard 9V power supply, and the power socket is located on the back- All kinds of sounds are possible. (personally, I only think one of them sounds realistic) disadvantages - the hissing noise is combined with the playing notes (or chords) - there is usually a little noise in the pedal chain - although I have several boss pedals, I think they always make the knob too small and the font / font too small. I prefer bigger pedals and fewer knobs that can adjust your toes if necessary. Details: the basic concept is good. I have an AC-2 (previous model) and sold it because it has a noise problem. When you play a note, there will be a hissing noise. It's not between notes or when it's not playing, it's combined with the sound of every note (or chord) you play, and you can't filter it. It's also just noise in the pedal chain. Adjusting your guitar volume to a higher gain pickup helps. However, I sold that model because I didn't want to put the pedal with other things, and I was not satisfied with its sound. At that time, the AC-2 sold for about $85. Boss redesigned and significantly increased the price of AC-3. I bought the AC-3 and hoped they could improve the AC-2 problem - they did, a little. But not enough to save it. I returned it a week later because it still had the same basic problems, but it was not so obvious. I think AC-3 can be used as a joke, but there are other options. It sounds like $25 instead of $130 to $150 (including tax and / or freight), so for me, the boss's pedal price is too high and not so good. I chose Bellinger acoustic modeler. They made two --a&#34; 300&#34;  And a&#34; 400&#34;.  400 reverberates on the pedal. I chose 300 and spent $25. I expect Bellinger's durability will be lower than that of the boss because it has a plastic shell. However, this is an effect that I occasionally quit because I can buy 4, 5 or 6 bellingers at my boss's price.... If it breaks... I'll buy another one. I also have a boss GT-100 multi effect device. You can get the same or similar acoustically modeled sound from Bellinger or boss AC-3. The least cost-effective of these options is AC-3, which has two other noise problems. I'm not saying it's a bad pedal, I'm just saying that considering the cost, sound and my mode of use, it's not my best choice. If they can solve the noise problem, I can even keep it. I did choose to keep Bellinger because I used discrete pedals and wanted an acoustic model effect. This boss is not so useful to me.",2

(personally, I only find one of them very realistic) disadvantages - the sound of whistling is combined with the playing notes (or chords) - the pedal chain is usually a little noisy - although I have several bosses, I think they always make buttons too small and fonts / characters too small. I prefer a larger pedal and fewer buttons to adjust your toes if necessary. Details: the basic concept is very good. I have an AC-2 (old model). I sold it because it has a noise problem. It hisses when you play a note. It is not between notes, and when it is not played, it is combined with the sound of each note (or chord) you play and cannot be filtered. Just the sound of the pedal chain. It's useful to adjust your guitar volume to a higher gain box. However, I sold this model because I don't want to step on the pedal with other things, and I'm not satisfied with the sound. At that time, the AC-2 sold for about $85.

"Summaries acoustics & 34. But strange in a strange way. I returned it. The price is what it is and is likely to be an alternative to the market. Pro - boss case is a metal, mechanical design is durable - standard 9V power supply, and power jack allows for various acoustic sounds on the back of which it belongs. (personally, I heard one of them sounds quite realistic) but (or chords) integrated sound and integrated noise are usually noisy in pedal chains. I prefer pedals with large and small knobs that can be tweaked with your toes as needed during playback. Details: basic concept is good. I had an AC-2 (pre model) and sold it as it had noise problems that had noisy noise when you make notes. When it wasn't between notes or played, it was integrated with the sound of every note you played (or chords), you couldn't filter it. It was just noisy with pedal chains. Adjusting your guitar volume for higher gain pickups help some. But I didn't want to pedal with all the others and I sold that model and I wasn't satisfied with the sound. At that time, AC-2 was sold for about $85 new. Since the boss redesigned and raised the price significantly in AC-3. I wanted AC-3 to improve the AC-2 problem - and they did a little. But it's not enough to keep it. I returned it just after a week because it still has the same basic problem. I think AC-3 has been able to work for jagged, but for me there is another choice that makes good sound for $25 instead of $130 to $150 (in tax and / or shipping) and the boss pedal is not a high price, and Not so big. I chose BEHRINGER acoustic modeler instead. They make two. 300 & A & 34; 400. 400 has a reverberation on the pedal. I chose 300 and got it for $25. I believe that durability is lower than boss with berringin because there is plastic case. But this is because I pull only one time and I can buy 4 or 5 or 6 behringers at the price of my boss. If it breaks. I'll buy one more. I also have a boss GT-100 multi impact unit. You can get the same or similar acoustic modeling from BEHRINGER or boss AC-3 out of it. The minimum cost effect of these alternatives is AC-3 - and it has a noise problem that no other two have. I'm not saying that bad pedal, I just say it's not the best choice for me when considering cost, sound and my use models. I might have even kept it if they solved the noise problem. I have been using the discrete pedboard and wanted to keep these times BEHRINGER wanting the effects of acoustic models. This boss pedal just didn't work well for me.",2
"General sound ok But it's strange. Me too. Compared with market alternatives, the price seems to be high. Advantages - the shell protrudes from the metal and the mechanical design is durable - the standard 9V power supply, and the socket is located on the back. All sounds are possible. (personally, I think one of them sounds realistic) the disadvantage is the combination of hissing noise and music (or chords) Notes - usually a little noisy on the pedal chain - although I have several pedals, I think they always make the pen too small and the font / font too small. I prefer more pedals and fewer handles that can adjust your fingers if you need to play. Details: the basic concept is very good. I have AC-2 (previous model). It was sold because it has noise problems. There will be hissing noise when you play music. It does not exist in any note, nor does it exist in another note. If it is combined with the sound of each note (or string) you play, you can't filter it. It's just the noise on the pedal chain. In order to increase the volume of the guitar, we can think of some ways However, I sold the model because I didn't want to put the pedal with other things. I was not satisfied with her voice. At that time, the price of Al-2 was about $85. Bosch modified the AC-3 and greatly increased the price. I bought AC-3 and hoped they could improve the AC-2 problem, what they did, and so on. But that's not enough to save him. I brought him back a week later because he still had the same basic problems, but not so obvious. I think as-3 can be used as a joke, but there are other options. I think it is $25 instead of $130-150 (including tax and / or freight), So for me, the boss's pedal price is too high and not very good. I chose bellins for acoustic simulation They made two - A & \ \ 35 years~ 3534??? And \ \ \ \ 35, 34; four hundred 400 on the reverberation pedal. I chose 300 and spent $25. I guess belling will have less endurance than the boss because he has a plastic shell. However, this is the effect that I sometimes refuse, because I can buy 4, 5 or 6 bellins at the boss's price If it breaks I want to buy one. I have more than 100% BOS GT equipment. You can get the same or similar sound from bellinge or boss AC-3. The most economical of these options is the AC-3, which has two other non noise options. I'm not saying it's a bad pedal, I'm just saying that considering the cost, sound and how I use this model, it's not my best choice. If they solve the noise problem, I can even save it. I did choose to keep belling because I used discrete pedals to get the effect of the acoustic model. This boss is not suitable for me.",2
"SummaryAcoustic sounds; 34? ok=35; 34? But noisy in strange ways. I brought it back. The price seems high for what it is and against alternatives on the market. Pros-Boss case is metal, mechanical design is sustainable, standard 9V power, and the power cap is on the back where it belongs. various acoustic sounds possible. (personally, I just thought that one of them sounded totally realistic)Cons-fizzy noise integrated with notes played (or chords) generally a little noisy in the pedal chains. Although I have different Boss pedals, I think they always make the buttons too small and the font/print too small. I prefer pedals with bigger and smaller buttons that can be adjusted with your toe if necessary during playing. Details:The basic concept is good. I had an AC-2 and sold it because it had a noise problem where there's a fizzy sound when you play a note. It was not between the notes or when it does not play, it was integrated with the sound of every note you played (or chord) and you could not filter it. It was also just loud in the pedal chain. Adjusting your guitar volume down for a higher profit pickups helps some. But I sold that model because I didn't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and I wasn't happy with the sound. At that time, the AC-2's sold for about $85 new. The boss has significantly increased the price of the AC-3. I bought the AC-3 in the hopes that they would have improved the problems of the AC-2. And they did, a little bit. But not enough to keep it. I reduced it after a week because it still has the same fundamental issues, only not so pronounced. I think the AC-3 can work for giggling, but there are other choices that sound just as good for $25 instead of $130 to $150 (with load and/or shipping) for me, the boss pedal is too expensive and not that big. I chose a Behringer acoustic model. They make two --a; 34? 300/34; and an ^plus-35; 34? 400)^34;. The 400's got a reflection on the pedal. I chose the 300 and got it for $25.

I prefer pedals with bigger and fewer buttons that can be tapped when playing with the toe if necessary. Details:The basic concept is good. I had an AC-2 (former model) and sold it because there was a noise problem where there was a rattling sound when playing a note. It was not between notes or if not played, it was integrated with the sound of every note you played (or chord) and you could not filter it. It was just loud in the pedal chain. Setting the guitar tree down for higher Gain Pickups helps some. Anyway, I sold this model because I didn't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and I wasn't happy with the sound. At that time the AC-2 sold for about 85 new. Boss since the redesign UND significantly increased the price on AC-3. I bought the AC-3 in the hope that they improved the output of the AC-2, and they did, a little. But not enough to keep it.

I think the AC-3 might work for Gigging, but there are other options that so und like this for $25 than for $130 to $150 (with steering and/or shipping), for me the master pedal is overpriced and not so great.

I had an AC-2 and I sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a carbon noise when you played a note. It wasn't between the notes or when it wasn't playing, it was embedded in the sound of every note you played (or chorus) and you couldn't filter it. It was also noisy in the pedal chain. Adjusting your guitar to make more money helps some people. However, I sold this model because I didn't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and I wasn't happy with the sound.

"Gunshot sound & 34; Good. But the sound is a little strange I'll pay it back. Compared with the alternatives in the market, its price seems to be high. Advantages - convex shell is metal, durability of mechanical design - standard 9V power supply, power socket on the back - can make a variety of sounds. (I personally think one of them sounds realistic) disadvantages - a combination of simple noise and playing notes (or code) - pedal chains are generally a little noisy- Although I have several boss pedals, I think they are always too small, and the font is too small. I like bigger pedals and fewer switches that can adjust your toes and play when necessary. Details: the basic style is very good. I sold it with an AC-2. Because it has a noise problem, you will have a rest noise when playing the phonetic symbols. When it is not between notes or does not play, it cannot be filtered in combination with the sound of all notes (or codes) you play. It's just pedal chain noise. It is helpful to adjust the other volume to a higher buff pickup. But I sold the model. Because I don't want to put the pedal with other things, and I'm not satisfied with its sound. At that time, the AC-2 sold for about $85. The boss redesigned and significantly increased the price of AC-3. I bought AC-3 and hope they can improve the problem of AC-2. They did. a little Not enough to save. I returned it a week later. Because it has the same basic problem. It's just not that obvious. I think the AC-3 can be joking, but there are other options, ranging from $130 to $150 (including taxes and / or freight), rather than $25. So I think the price of the boss's pedal is too high and not very good. I chose Bellinger's sage model. They made two - A & 34. 300 & 34; a&#34; 400&#34;.  400 makes a mixed sound on the pedal. I chose $300 and spent $25. I reckon belline's durability will be lower than that of the boss. Because it has a plastic shell. But this is the effect of my occasional retreat. Because I can buy 4, 5 or 6 bellingers at the boss's price. If that doesn't work. I'll buy another one. Boss GT-100 multi effect device also has one The same or similar sound modeling sound can be obtained in Bellinger or boss AC-3. Among these options, AC-3 has the lowest cost efficiency, and there are two other noise problems that do not exist. I'm not saying that this is a bad springboard, but that considering the cost, sound and my use mode, this is not my best choice. If they can solve the noise problem, I can even keep it. I chose to save Bellinger. Because I used pedals at that time, I hope to achieve the effect of Saint model. The boss is not so useful to me.",2

I prefer larger pedals and fewer knobs that can adjust my toes if necessary. Details: the basic concept is good. I have an AC-2 (previous model) and I sold it because it has noise problems and whistles when you play notes. When it is not between notes or is not played, it will be combined with the sound of each note (or chord) you play, and you can't filter it. It's just the noise on the pedal chain. It helps to adjust your guitar volume for higher gain. However, I sold the model because I didn't want to put the pedal with other things. I was not satisfied with its sound.

"All the sounds and 34 are good, but strangely, my price seems to be higher than the market choice. The 9V standard power socket designed by shell machinery is located at the back. Sound is possible Personally, I think one of them sounds very real. The disadvantage is that it's always a little noisy in my throttle chain. But boss, I think it's too small a ball and the letters are too small. I like the larger knob, which can adjust your toes. If necessary, I have AC-2 in the basic concept of playing well Because there is a sound and sound problem when you play. It's not recorded or not together. Play every record or chord you play, you can't filter it. It's just a sound, pedal, adjusting your guitar volume to get a higher system will help some. However, I do this because I don't want to put other things, I'm not satisfied with the sound. The prices of boss and AC-3, which sell for about $85, have risen sharply. I bought AC-3 and hope to improve the problem of AC-2. I can do some vectors, but that's not enough. I came back a week later because I still have one basic question, but I don't know. I think AC-3. It may be the universe, but there are other options. It sounds like $25, not 130 to 150. So it's not good for my boss to be too expensive. I chose belling sound system. They choose 300 for me, for me, for me, for me, for me, for me, and pay $25 for me. I hope bringer's ego will have a plastic shell than he does. However, as a result, I sometimes quit. I would buy four, five or six bellingers at the boss's price. If I lost it, I would buy it. I also work for the boss GT-100 multifunction device. You can get the same or similar sound from ringer. AC-3 boss, the lowest cost of these options is AC-3, which has two other audio problems. I'm not saying it's a bad victim. I'm just saying it's not my best choice. Mine. I can put it if I can solve the noise. I chose burlinger because I used a discontinuous noise victim. The boss was bad to me.",2

I prefer big pedals and small handles. I can adjust my toes if necessary. Details: good basic concept. I have an AC-2 (previous model) sold because it has a noise problem. There is a whisper noise when I play notes. It's not between notes or playing. When you combine each note with the sound you play (or chord), you can't filter it out.

However, this is an impact that I sometimes quit because I can buy 4, 5 or 6 sets of Bellinger at my boss's price. If it doesn't work. I'll buy another one. I have a multifunctional trainer with more than 100 sets. You can get the same or similar sound model from Boehringer or AC-3 coach.

The binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius, so it will cut into the chest and arms after playing - something I've never encountered before- I can get very, very low before my troubles rattle - good!

The problem was smaller than the competitors, but their good combination was a 90 degree acute angle and no radius, so she cut her chest and arm after the game - I've never seen it before. I can do some very, very low movements before boredom breaks out - good! Generally speaking, this is a high-quality instrument because it is made in Canada at the price of Asia and Mexico.

"I heard a big thing about S6, so I'm a beginner without ideas for buying anything, I bought it on a review.

Headstock headstock with a small, large tutor looks from the place in the Dreadnaught guitar. Cedar top is very clean and rosewood fretboard / Bridge on me is very good. The side / back of the laminates look much thicker than the guitar playing, and this makes the guitar heavier and I Cedar & amp; satin finish cedar tops are very warm with the low and mid strumming power, but with heavy strum, the top is going to lose the bottom and lose definition FRET is smaller than competitor, but it is okay. Binding is a sharp 90 degree angle, it has no radius and cuts the arm and arm after the chest. I can get very low action very low FRET rattle - nice! All in all, it is simply made in Canada for the price of Asia / Mexico, so it's coming from Canada, so it is an OK device that stands out for the reason that it is not embodiing it with a mysterious vibe. In fact, for a range of price, I am better laminate back / front, skipper loose Solitaire top wood, better tuner With a glossy finish for durability with more attractive headstock and it can get just good Asian / Mexico guitar as well.

"I heard great things about the S6 and so, a beginner with no idea what to buy, I bought it based on ratings. I played it for a year, and after spending many hours in guitar shops comparing guitars, here are my (modest) thoughts:- The seagull is relatively unattractive. His snake head with the small, non-big tuners doesn't look good on a dreadnaught guitar. The cedar top looks very nice, and the Rosewood frethord/bridge on mine are very nice. The laminated sides/back seem much thicker than the competing guitars, and this makes the guitar heavier and, for me, less \; 34? Live'; 34; resonant while playing. The satin-finished cedar top is very easy to brown. The cedar is warm from low to middle of the span force, but with a heavy stream, the top appears to come out and lose the definition. The treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom looks muddy. The ferrets are smaller than the competitors, but they're fine. The binding is a sharp 90-degree angle without any radius so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing... Something I've never met before. I can get the action very, very low before the ferret rattles. Great. All in all, it is an OK instrument that stands out simply because it was made in Canada for Asian/Mexican prices. That said, just because it comes from Canada doesn't embody mystical vibrations. In fact, for the price class, I can have an equally good Asian/Mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back/front, Sitka spar solid top wood, better tuners, and a more attractive headstock--with a glossy finish for sustainability and that sounds just as good. I do not regret it, but I feel that I have paid too much for what I have received, and although the brand may have been worth a lot at the exchange rates of the last ten years, I have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price.

The connection is a 90-degree steep angle with no radius so it cuts into the chest and hands after the game- something I've never met before. I can have the action very, very low before the stress goes... Great! Generally, it's an OK instrument that stands out simply because it's made in Canada for Asian/Mexican prices, which he said, Just because it comes from Canada doesn't embody it with mystical vibrations. In fact, for the price range, I can get an equally good Asian/Mexican guitar with a better back/forth, a solid wood granite, better tunes, And a more attractive headset with a shiny finish to endurance and that sounds just as good. I don't regret taking it, but I feel like I paid too much for what I got, and while the brand may have been too big with last decade's exchange rates, I've seen much better guitars in stores at the same price. Glarus is too sensitive for me. Thanks for reading!",2
"I heard good news about S6. So as a beginner, I don't know what to buy, so I bought it according to the comments. I've been playing for a year. I spent a lot of time comparing guitar in other aspects, and then my (humble) idea- Seagulls are less attractive. Its snakehead frame and small are not great adjusters, but are not suitable for guitars without fear. My red neck trim / legs are also beautiful The laminated side / back seems to be much thicker than the competitor's guitar. The guitar is heavier and less for me & 34; The cypress coat on the surface of the living 34 year old / sympathetic terminal is easy to get dirty. Although cedar is very warm under low impact, it seems to lose justice when it hits the ground under heavy impact. The treble is small for me, but the ground looks muddy. Although the distress is smaller than that of the competitive company, it belongs to a sharp 90 degree angle and has no radius, so the chest and arms will be cut off after playing- This is something I've never seen before- I can do it very low before I get upset- Good! In short, it's a good instrument. Because it is made in Canada at Asian / Mexican prices. In other words, just because they are from Canada, they do not show a mysterious atmosphere. In fact, from the price range, I can buy the same good Asian / Mexican guitar. It has a better back / full layer board, lemon tree top, better regulator and more attractive spindle box - shiny decorative surface, which can be used for a long time and sounds good. I don't regret buying it. But I think what I received is too expensive. Although according to the exchange rate of the past decade, this brand may be a large number. But I saw a better guitar at the same price in the store. Seagulls are too exaggerated for me Thank you for reading!",2
"I heard the good news about S6, so as a novice, I don't know what to buy. I bought it according to the feedback. I have been playing for a year. After spending a lot of time comparing guitars in the guitar store, I have an idea (modest): - seagulls are not so attractive. Its snakehead and its small and small tuner don't seem to fit a fearless guitar. The cedar top looks good. My chessboard / mahogany bridge is very beautiful. The side / back stack seems to be much thicker than the competitor's guitar, which makes the guitar heavier and less for me &#34; The 34 year old echoed a cedar Satin jacket in the competition, which was easy to get dirty. Cedar is warm under low to medium knocking force, but under heavy knocking force, the top seems to have touched the bottom and lost its clarity. The high voice sounds small to me and the bottom looks muddy. The problem is smaller than the competitors, but they are very good. This joint has an acute angle of 90 degrees and no radius, so it cut its chest and arm after the game - I've never seen it before. Before my trouble makes noise, I can do very, very low movements - good! In short, it's a very good tool because it's made in Canada at Asian / Mexican prices - that is, just because it's from Canada, it doesn't show a mysterious atmosphere. In fact, within the price range, I can buy an equally good Asian / Mexican guitar with better rear / front panel, a Sitka spruce solid wood upper, a better tuner and a more attractive spindle - smooth, durable, sounds good. I don't regret buying it, but I think what I get is too expensive. Although the brand may have changed a lot in the past decade, I saw better guitars at the same price in the store.

"I heard the good news about S6, so as a novice, I don't know what to buy. I bought it in the comments. I've been playing the guitar for more than a year and spent a lot of time in the guitar store. This is my idea. My seagull is modest. It has ears and small. It is not a good transformer and is not suitable for a brave guitar. The top of cedar is very good, and my mahogany bridge is very beautiful. Raminde seems to think that the competitor's guitar makes my guitar a little more difficult in my life 344. The old year easily reflects the smooth cedar shirt Warm low to the middle of the cedar, but with a heavy top, it seems to touch the ground and lose its meaning. The high-profile voice sounds very small, and my muddy bottom has fewer problems than competitors. It is sharp and has no radius, so playing it will cut the chest and shoulders, which has never been seen before. I kept a low profile until I was worried. In short, this is a great musical instrument. It is built in Canada, Asia and Mexico. From the mysterious atmosphere of Canada In fact, within the price range, I bought a good Asian guitar like bilaminde, Mexico. On the front and top of the hardwood, better thinner, more interest I don't regret buying it, but I think what I get is too expensive, although this brand may have a great impact on the exchange rate in ten years. A year ago, my score in a guitar store was better than seagull, which was too difficult for me. Thank you for reading.",2

I spent a lot of time comparing guitars in the guitar store. Here's my (modest) idea: seagulls are not so attractive. This is a small, not very good-looking tuner, not suitable for fear guitar. The cedar top is beautiful, my mahogany trim panel / bridge is also beautiful, and the laminated side / back looks much thicker than the opponent's guitar, which makes the guitar heavier and less for me. The 34 year old neighbor gets dirty easily when playing with a cedar Satin coat. Japonica rice is warm under low temperature to medium intensity blow, but under strong blow, it seems that the top has touched the bottom. The triple looks too small and the bottom looks muddy. The problem is that it is smaller than the opponent, but it doesn't matter. It has an acute angle of 90 degrees and no radius. Even after the game, it will cut its chest and arm - something I've never encountered before. I can make very, very low movements before my question creaks - very good! In short, this is a good tool because it is made in Canada at the price of Asia / Mexico - that is, just because it comes from Canada does not show a mysterious atmosphere.

"I heard great things about S6 and so, being a novice with no idea what to buy, I bought it based on reviews. I played it for a year, and after spending many hours in guitar shops comparing guitar, here are my (humble) thoughts:- The seagull is relatively unattractive. His snake head with the little not-big dorks looks out of place on a scary guitar. The top of cedar is very nice, and the pole gymnasium on mine is very nice. The laminated sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars, and this makes the guitar heavier and, for me, less \35;34; LOCATION LIVE;35 34; resonance during playback. The top of cedar finished with shave is very easy to marry. The cedar is warm at low to medium strumming force, but at a heavy strum, the upper part seems to come out and lose definition. The treble sounds tinkle for me and the bottom looks muddy. The wires are smaller than the competitors, but they're OK. The ligament is a 90-degree cutting angle with no radius, so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing something I've never met before. I can do the action very, very low before the arrows melt. All in all, it is an OK tool that distinguishes itself simply because it is made in Canada for Asian/Mexican prices- that said, just because it comes from Canada does not incarnate with mystical vibrations. In fact, for the price range, I can get an equally good Asian/Mexican guitar with a nicer back/front laminate, Sitka sprinkles solid top wood, better tunichers, and a more attractive healttock with a polished finish for the duration and that sounds just as good. I do not regret having received it, but it seems to me that I have paid too much for what I have received, and although the label could have been much more at exchange rates than the last decade, I have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price. Seagull's too excited for me. Thanks for reading!",2

"I'm a tone freak. I bought this pedal not long ago, and the impression was that it sounded like a big sleeve. I never had a big scarf at that time. I thought the sound it made was the sound of big muffle. Later, I took it to my friend's house and matched the setting with a real big cover. The difference is huge. The big cover sounds Fuller, while the small cover sounds like you put the sound in a small box. Then I bought a big muffle, which is one of my favorite pedals for at least three years. I still like it now, but I'm curious about nano big muff because I want to make room on my board, but if it sounds a little untrue, I may not use it.

I thought the sound it produced was a big muff sound. I took it to my friend's house later and matched the setting with a real big muff. The difference was large. The big muff sounded fuller as little as you heard, took a little sound and locked it into a little box. I bought a big muff later and that one was going to the jagged pedals for at least three years. I love it now but I'm looking to clear space on my board, so I'm interested in nano big muff.

"On the bright side, these monitors look and feel great. They were coated with silk like rubber, heavy and neat. It doesn't sound terrible. I mean, they're not computer speakers or anything else.

I have used KRK rp8 before, so I can compare them with them. To be sure, they are bigger and more expensive, although they are also budget supervisors. I like them better than these. They are clear, but they also sound good. Of course, there are more bass. I'm going to put a subwoofer on it and burn them... See if I can improve the situation... But one of the speakers started buzzing after 5 minutes. As time went on, the volume of the buzzing became louder and louder. I tried to move them to another place, turn down the volume, and even disconnect the audio input (so they just plug in). Nothing can stop the buzzing. If they are heated, you turn them off and turn them on again, and the buzz will start in 10 or 20 seconds. So I sent them back. I'm not very satisfied with its sound, and I'm not satisfied with its quality control, so I'm going to try a bigger and more expensive monitor. Maybe Bellinger 3031a or something.

"On the plus side these monitors look amazing. They are coated with some sort of Silk rubber and they are heavy and look neat. They don't have a terrible noise. In other words, they are not computer speakers or anything. The sound is very forward, I say strict. It's not unusual among studio monitors. Here are clearly many clarity. Not based on tons, it is considerably understood from this size woofer monitor. There are several schools of studio monitor ideas. Some people think that they are basically to draw wart in your music, others think they should sound like regular speakers. These will be glad for those who are interested first. I hear music is right on your face when you're listening to this. Any defect would be very noticeable. I used KRK rp8 before. They are also budget monitors, but they are higher and more expensive. Hope you like it. They were clear, but also had a better sound, and of course, had a lower bass. I put the woofer on these and burn them. See if I can improve the situation... But one of the speakers begins to swell about five minutes after it turns on. Volume increases with progress of buzz time. I tried to move to another location, cut down the volume and cut the audio feed (they were connected to the power source). Nothing stopped the topic. Buzz will start like more than 10 or 20 seconds if they are warm and you turn them off and turn on again. So I sent them back. I wasn't really impressed with the sound and I'm certainly not satisfied with quality control, so I'm going to try some bigger and more expensive monitors instead.

The bass is not much, but it is an almost understandable size monitor with subwoofer. There are some ideas on the monitor in the studio Some people think they are mainly to show the defects in your music, while others think their sound should be more like an ordinary speaker. It will be much happier for the first person interested. When you listen to this song, I hear it like music looking at your face. Any shortcomings are obvious. I use KRK rp8 to compare them.

All these negative factors aside, you can buy a reverb pedal for less than $40. It has several functions available. The 63 foot spring is great and the plate is good. It also has a ""space"" function worth mentioning. Also known as shimmer (a synthesizer played behind your instrument). With the chorus effect, you can get some very cool tones. Rv600 is not without advantages, but it is a cheap pedal, which is very interesting to use. If you need reverberation for singing or recording... Okay, you didn't even look at this pedal.

However, if you do install it at the bottom of the circuit board as recommended, you will encounter an unpleasant surprise. First, about the two circular holes on the front of the plate. Where is the power supply... To some extent. There is no way to fully align them because the hole in Pedal Train 2 is slightly too close. I am not worried about this because I doubt whether I will chain them and can only visit one store. The second problem is that it is alleged that the self tapping screws attached to the installation tool bar appear to be made of butter. Once you let them in (or try to do so), they'll never come out. You may have to break them. It's a pity to cut corners on such a cheap thing.

Once the power supply is correctly installed at the bottom of the circuit board (only one position can be installed), start inserting the pedal and find that the cable provided by the power supply does not match the installation position on the circuit board. Because there is not enough clearance between the pedal frame and the cable insertion socket, they cannot be inserted.

You'll probably have to break them. It's a shame things are so cheap. The main problem I have with this advice regarding my voodoo power lab is this. After properly mounting the power to the bottom of the plate (you can only place it in one place), you start to connect the pedals and discover that the wires supplied with the power supply do not match the mounting place on the plate. They cannot be connected because there is not enough distance between the frame of the pedals and the sockets to which the cables connect. I only bought this record because it's perfectly compatible with the Voodoo Lab power I have, but considering it doesn't fit the way it should, I'd like to return it, but I can't, because now it's got holes in it. (You have to drill the board to install power under it.) Basically, I paid $100 for a simple metal rectangle and some turnips. I don't have to say I'm not happy.",2

"I bought H4n because I am not satisfied with the performance of H2. Because the performance of H2 is the most important, I cannot record a signal with good sound, and the signal will not be distorted by the line in the jack. It was found that H4n had the same problem, but it was not so bad. If I try to record a line level signal from a soundboard or stereo receiver and connect it to the 1 / 4 inch jack of H4n, it is almost impossible not to produce a distorted signal. On both models, the line in the preamplifier seems to be too sensitive and easy to clip. Because it is clipped in the preamplifier, adjusting the gain does not correct it. I contacted zoom's technical support department about H2 and they told me that there might be a defective device. I returned H2 and decided to give zoom another chance to try H4n after seeing many positive comments. I really like the design of H4n. The menus and controls are well organized. It is stronger than H2. The recording quality using the built-in microphone is very good. Most other recorders in this price range do not have XLR input. Since I plan to use it mainly to record concerts by connecting line output or recording on the soundboard, if the line input jack does not work properly and can not accept the normal line level signal without editing, I can't use it for the purpose of buying it. In the past 8 years, I have used my Sony mini disc recorder for the same type of applications without any problems. I have cooperated with professional audio equipment for more than 25 years and have used many types of recorders. So far, zoom product is the only product I encounter this problem. If you use it to record a microphone, it works well, but if you need to record from a line source, a zoom recorder may not be a good choice. I replaced it with TASCAM dr-07. Although TASCAM doesn't have so many bells and whistles, it is a good recorder. I'm very satisfied with it.",2

If you use it to record a microphone, it works well, but if you need to record from a line level source, using the zoom recorder may not be a good choice. I replaced it with TASCAM dr-07. Although TASCAM doesn't have so many bells and whistles, it is a good recorder. I'm very satisfied.",2
"I purchased H4n, H4 performance is the most important. So I couldn't record a good ringing signal that was not distorted in line with Jack. See that H4n has the same problem, but not bad. It is almost impossible to have distorted signals if I try to connect the line level signal from the soundboard or stereo receiver and connect to a 1 / 4-inch jack of H4n. It appears to be a very sensitive, very easy clip in both models in the model, and adjusting the gain does not correct it because it is clipping in the preamplifier. I contacted the technical support for zoom about H2 and I was told that there was probably a broken unit. I decided to return H2 and try H4n after zooming another chance and seeing many positive checks. I really like the H4n design, menus and controls are well organized. It is sturdy than H2. Record quality with built-in microphone. Most other recorders in this price range do not have an XLR input. I am going to use it primarily to record a concert by connecting to a line board or by connecting tapes to the soundboard, so if the jack row doesn't work properly If I can't accept a normal line level signal without clipping, I can't use this for what I bought it. I did not have any problems using the Sony minidisc recorder for the same type of applications in the past eight years. I have worked with professional sound equipment for over 25 years and have used many kinds of recorders so the zoom product is the only thing I've encountered this problem. It works great if you are using this to record with the microphone, but the zoom recorder may not be a good choice if you need to record from a line level source. I replaced this for TASCAM dr-07 and it's a nice recorder while TASCAM doesn't have many bells and whistles, and I'm very happy with it.",2
"I bought H4n because I am not satisfied with the quality of H2 because its performance is the most important. I can't record a good signal. It won't be distorted by the line in the slot. It turns out that H4n has the same problem, but it's not that bad. If I try to record the line level signal from a record or stereo receiver and connect it to the quarter inch H4N jack, The signal is unlikely to be distorted. In both models, the circuits in the preamplifier seem too sensitive to edit because they are installed in the preamplifier, So the gain adjustment cannot correct it. I contacted the technical support department of ZOMA company to learn about H2, and they told me that there might be a defective equipment. I brought back H2 and decided to give Zhuoma a chance to try H4n. At the same time, I read a lot of positive comments. I like the design of H4n very much. The menus and controls are well organized It is stronger than H2. The recording quality of the built-in microphone is very good. Most of the other recorders in this price range were not introduced by canon. Because I intend to use it mainly to record concerts through line output or recording on records. If line input doesn't work well, I can't accept the normal line signal level. It's not installed. I can't buy it with it. In the past 8 years, I have used my Sony disc for the same type of application without any problems. I have used professional recording equipment for more than 25 years and used different types of recorders. So far, ZOMA's products are the only products, I met. It works well if you record the microphone with it, but it may not be the best choice if you need to record it from a string source. I changed it to TASCAM dr-07. Although there are not many bells and whistles in TASCAM, it is a good recorder. I am very satisfied with it.",2
"I bought the H4n after I was unhappy with H2's performance... where I couldn't pick up a good-sounding signal... that wasn't distorted with the Line In Jack. Just to see that the H4n has the same problem, but not so bad. When I try to record a signal from a sound level or a stereo receiver and connect to the H4n's 1/4 inch jack, it's almost impossible to have no distorted signal. It seems that on both models the line in preemp is too sensitive and clips very easy and because clamping in the preamble, adjusting the profit is not correct. I contacted Zoom's technical support about the H2 and was told I probably had a defective unit. I returned the H2 and decided to give Zoom another chance and try the H4n after seeing many positive reviews. I think the H4n design is very well organized. It feels stronger than the H2. The recording quality with the help of the built-in microphones is excellent. Most other recorders in this price range do not have XLR inputs. Since I intend to use it mainly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape on a sound board, if the line in crickets does not work well and cannot accept a normal line level signal without clippings, I cannot use this for what I bought for.

"H4n purchased Because it is not satisfied with the performance of H2. The performance of H2 is the most important, so I can't record a good sound signal. This signal is not true due to the wiring of the plug hole. As a result, H4n has the same problem, but it is not very bad. If I try to record a line level signal on a soundboard or stereo receiver and connect it to the 1 / 4 inch plug of H4n, almost no actual signal will occur. In both models, the wiring of the bulb amplifier seems to be too sensitive and easy to edit. Because it is edited by the bulb amplifier, the adjustment benefit is uncorrectable. Contacted zoom's technical support department to understand the possible defective device of H2 I decided to give my aunt another chance. After seeing many positive comments, I tried H4n. I like the design, menu and control of H4n very much. It's stronger than H2. The recording quality using the built-in microphone is very good. Most other recorders in this price range do not have Canon input. Because it is planned to connect the line output or record on the music board, the line input plug can not work normally and can not accept the normal line level signal. If I don't edit it, I can't use it for the purpose of buying it. In the past 8 years, I have used my Sony Mini record encoder in the same application, and there has never been any problem. I have cooperated with professional audio equipment for more than 25 years and used many types of tape recorders. So far, zoom product is the only product I have experienced this problem If you use it to record the microphone, it works well, but if you have to record in the line, the zoom may not be a good choice.

"I bought H4n because I was not satisfied with the performance of H2. Because this is the most important, I have a good audio recording, will not be distorted by the line, it becomes H4n. There is the same problem, but not so bad if I try to record from a record or turntable level and connect to H4n 1-4. It is almost impossible for sharp fingers to send out signals without distortion. These two circuits in the tower seem too sensitive and easy to modify because it is the correct amplifier, so adjustment is impossible. I contacted zoom technical support to learn about H2 and vector and told me that it may have defective equipment. I went back to H2 and decided to zoom in and saw a lot of positive comments on H4n. I really like H4n menu design and good organization control. It is better than H2. The quality of records is very good. Most other records do not enter at this price. Because I'm going to use it to record a connection or record it on the vocal cord, if it's Jack. There is no correct work, there is no normal level signal, in the past eight years, I have used Sony Mini CD. I wrote the same type of program and never had any problems. I worked with professional audio equipment for 25 years. Multiple recorders are used, so the product zoom is the only product. I have this problem. If you use it to record microwaves, it works, but if you want to record from a source, it may not be a good choice. I changed it to tasam-07, and TASCAM doesn't have bells and lemons.

The first is lemon it 's nothing. Even the room fell. I like this design, but they must be strong enough to withstand the weight of the microphone and the use of ordinary recording studios. For example, adjust the position of the microphone, move with the microphone holder, and so on Otherwise, there is no option to adjust the tilt. Make it hard. I want to repair it with gorilla rubber. Because I really like its design. It's just not strong. But this is not surprising. There's not so much money to get this way. These days, they gave them back the damn bits and pieces of products that don't need to pay attention to the actual test. Why did they do that? They already have your money. I think I should be compensated for their product testing and packaging time. Besides, what are they going to do? Are you sure to replace other damaged $$products? What's better is to return the product fee I paid- Remove freight???? It doesn't include how much time I spent preventing and testing you from buying damn products. After refund, you can get the time salary. Don't buy it anyway. Companies that don't test their products are not worth your business.

"I really hope this is a great product. Screws come off easily. Basically, if you put on a microphone, you have to use it as a microphone and it will fall off. I have two. I hope the first one is lemon. No, no, even the blowout preventer has fallen off. I like this design, but they need to be strong enough to support the weight of the microphone and use a conventional studio... For example: adjust the microphone position, lift and move the microphone stand, etc. otherwise, there is no adjustable tilt option. Make a solid. I really want to try to repair it with rubber gorilla, because I really like its design, but it's not strong enough. But that's not surprising. Now, nothing is more valuable than this. These days, what they don't care about in return is the trivia of fucking testing products. Why did they do that? They have your money. I think you should pay me to test your products and the time I spend unpacking and packaging. Besides, what are they going to do? Replace it with another damaged $$product?

"I hope this is a good product. Basically, if you send a micropore, when you use it as a microwave, it will be robbed. I have two, I hope the first is lemon. Even BOP. I like this design, but they must be strong enough to withstand microgravity and normal studio. For example, the position and movement of microtubules, otherwise there is no other choice to make it solid. I want to try fat with Google because I like its design, but it's not strong enough, but it's not surprised. Nothing is worth so much money. These days, all the complaints that they don't care about real test products. Why are they doing this? They have your money. I think I should get the money to test the vector product and spend the time on closing and repackaging. What will he do? Instead of damaged products, it's better for me to pay the cost and reduce the transportation cost. It doesn't include the time I tried to stop you from buying a product to test their madness. I need a refund and an hourly payroll, anyway. Companies that don't test products are not worth your business. I'm glad a company produces these products. Answer this question.

For example, adjust the position of the microphone, pick up the microphone stand and move the microphone, otherwise there is no choice of adjustable tilt. Make solid. I like to repair with gorilla glue because I like this design. Just not strong enough. But that's not surprising. There's nothing valuable these days.

It's a hell of a duty to return every damn purchase these days that they really don't care about testing the products. Why? They already have your money.

If you want to use it in Ni, EZ, aldrmer or any other similar program, you must know how to redirect MIDI map use. This is not a plug and play project, and you will spend hours trying to make it work with the program. There is almost no useful information on the Internet. I have used it for more than a week. I don't use it because it is an independent project. No MIDI support. I'm giving up the fight and sending it back. If Alice creates a MIDI output port on the module and you can run Dao and programs, then this is an amazing project that can be easily 1000 times.",2
"Well, three hours to get together gets tired and annoying, since things tend to fall apart. However, as standalone elements it is great with good sounds and groove tracks to practice drumming on. But I'm not a drummer and I have no interest in becoming one. I bought this to use with the recording of basic beat software to customize my songs. And it's a NIGHT MAREGEGEGING in a week now no help from either company. It bothered me if you want to use this with NI, EZ DRUMMER or other programs like this you need to know how to restore MIDI input in order to use it. This is not a plug and play element that you will spend time trying to get this to work with the software... There's little useful information on the network that I've owned for more than a week and I've never used it for its purpose, yet it's an object on its own. There is no MIDI support. I'm about to stop fighting and send him back. Alesis could have made this an incredible object and a hundred times easier if you simply created a midi port out on the module you could run in your daw and software.",2

"I bought this to amplify my voice cheaply. I learned a lesson. I should give the money to the emergency room. I have a Yamaha f335. I like it very much. I said someone amplified his guitar with a piezoelectric transducer, so I think I should try. I first spent about $3 on a sensor and did an experiment. I like it. It sounds good. Then I saw this from Axl. I think I should try it. It's nice to install it, but I spent $10 on an unnecessary drill bit. So I installed it and plugged it in. It sounded good from the beginning. I just want to play at home, so I don't need good sound quality. But the sound is OK, except that it can hear every loud noise and percussion, especially my planetary wave. I think it is a quick connect belt connector. My other complaint is that I can't turn the volume up too much without sharp feedback. The overall product quality is good. The installation is OK. The price is good. In my opinion, the sound needs some adjustment.",2

"For many years, I mainly used alchemical strings, but I'm tired of spending so much on them. I think I should try the others at half price to see if there is any extra. This is the first time to continue. Compared with my previous experience, this is a great progress. The string I took off is about two months old, and there are corrosion spots on the high E string. They sound twice as loud as these. When you take these things out, they plop out like wet spaghetti. They don't decompose as fast as strings. The advantages here outweigh the disadvantages. Advantages: - very flexible, the strings are easy to bend, and the fingers are easy to bend: - this is the dullest sound of all the strings I have ever heard. Especially at the low end. They are very lack of rich low-end sound. The high point is small. It sounds like a bad recording - your fingers stick when you try to slide down the string. This is the strangest thing. This is especially true for G strings. It's hard to explain, but it's a bit like rubbing on clean things. Your hands are doing that kind of jumping friction, and then there will be a lot of squeaks. Anyway, it's bad. The grip is the last thing you want. Bottom line: you shouldn't buy unless you have severe arthritis and must have super flexible strings. I'll never buy it again.

Advantages: - very flexible, strings are easy to bend, fingers are easy to bend: - this is the most boring sound of all strings I've ever heard. Especially at the low end.

"I've been using alchemy strings for many years, but just tired of so much spending for them. I try to try some other at half price and see the stack. These were the first steps from what they had first and what they had. The string I took off was probably two months ago and there was a high E string corrosion. They were twice as large as these. When you take these in the pack, they sort out like a sweat spaghetti. They do not quickly dissolve that strings do generally. Cons certainly exceeds the pro here. Pro: - very flexible, string bending is easy on the fingers: Easy: the dull sound of any string I've ever heard. Especially at low end. They are badly deficient in a rich low finish sound. Altitude is very small. Most sounds like a bad record stick when your finger tries to slide the string. It is strange. This is especially true for G strings. It's hard to explain, but it's like rubbing something really clean, where your hands do skip such friction. Anyway, it sucks. Grip is the last of your string. Bottom line: you have some evil arthritis and you just need to buy these without bending the strings easily. I won't buy again. This was my first time in my life to change a new brand string.",2

Their voices are twice as loud as these. When you take these things out, they jump out like wet spaghetti. They don't decompose as quickly as strings. The advantages here outweigh the disadvantages. Advantages: - dexterous, easy to bend strings, easy to bend fingers: - this is the darkest string I've ever heard. Especially the bottom. They are very lack of voice. The height is very low. It sounds like a bad recording - your fingers stick together when you try to slide off the string. This is the strangest thing. This applies especially to line G. It's hard to explain, but it's a bit like rubbing on a clean thing. When your hands do such jumping friction, they make a lot of screams. Anyway, this is not good. Burning is the last thing you want.

They were twice as loud as this. If you take these out of the package, they'll flake out like wet spaghetti. They don't do the fast unraveling thing that strings usually do. The odds are bigger than the pros here. Pros:-Very flexible, cord turns are easy for the finger Cons:-The most boring sound of strings I have ever heard. Especially on the low side. They don't have a good sound. The heights are very small. Almost sounds like a bad recording. Keep sticking your fingers when you try to slip through the strings. It's the weirdest thing. This applies especially to the G-string. It's hard to explain, but it's kind of rubbing against something very clean, where your hand does that skip some kind of rubbing and there's tons of paging to start with. Either way, it sucks. Grip is the last thing you want to be doing. The bottom line is: unless you have a bad arthritis and just have to have super easy to bend strings, these should not be bought. I'll never buy again.

They sound twice as loud as this. When you take out these things, they plop down like wet spaghetti. They don't decompose as fast as strings. The benefits here outweigh the disadvantages. Advantages: - very soft, the strings are easy to bend, and the fingers are easy to bend- This is the heaviest sound of all the strings I have heard. Especially at the lower level, they lack rich vulgar voices. The height is very small. It sounds like a messy recording - your fingers stick together when you try to slide the strings.

At least this is a big deal. The handle is the last thing you want. Bottom line: don't suffer from severe arthritis. Have strings that bend easily. Or don't buy it. I'll never buy it again.

"For years, I've been using string alchemy, and I'm tired of spending them. I think I should see what else is half price. This is my first time to go, which is a greater progress than my previous experience. I have an old string of about two months, the treble of these pencils. When you put these things like wet spaghetti, they don't break down into strings quickly. This is the most boring sound I've ever heard. Especially at the bottom, they lack high and low sounds that sound like a bad record. Your fingers will stick to what you want to slide, which is the strangest thing, especially G String It's hard to explain, but it's just a little rub on your hand to make a jump. It's a big noise.

The bgic that is not accepted, but not fixed, is a look, but if you're like me, switching the presets is not helpful than switching FX blocks on & off. Then, as one pedal (OD) turns OD, you can combine blocks, turn both late and chorus off, turn on one amp, and change one off (channel switching). Ah! Hope you like it. Thus, you can enable / disable four sets using four pedsets. Oh SOD it. Tap nope tempo? Neither. So in summary, express is superior to anything but certainly does not provide desktop free operation..

EXP2c) Insert another FX enabled by the foot button, and controlled by the pedal as EXP1d) tap temperature (by recording the currently selected preset, i.e. the pedal that is lit)e) enable the tuner (press/hold the current pre-selected pedal)f) you have some basic looper control, But you can't drive. 3/10/14 EDIT:Looper control is flawed. You can record and go into overdub, but you cannot record, then play/stop the loop. you can stop overdub, but do not initiate the loop. apparently a bugNice recognized and not finalized enough, but if you are like me, changing presets is much less useful than changing FX blocks into &off. incidentally you can combine blocks in such a way that a pedal (say) turns on OD, and delay the ID chorus either off, or turn on an amp and an off (channel change). YAY!! You cry, it's just like me then it's a NO to ABCD and FS5-FS8 mode it's for me!.. SO yup in FS5-8 mode that you can do this, you can) enable/disable four sets of blocks using the four pedalsb) use volume and expression options as above (i.e. similar volume or wah, overtake level, FB delay, etc.) Basic looper control But cannot enable itEDIT 3/19/14 failed looper control as stated above) enable the tuner...? Oh, screw that. Can't you play the weather? Neither is this. In short, the Express is better than nothing, but it certainly does not provide free desktop operating hands. The shortboard's worth the extra, or if you're reading this before you buy the pod. Take the HD500x instead.",2
"Before I bought the FBV, I searched the network to see how it works with the POD HD desktop, and even an advanced user guide allows you to think. Anyway, I got lucky, and I found out that it's used cheaply, and after a while, I discovered exactly what can and cannot be done with POD HD and FBV Express II. 1. First, do not turn on the FBV Express on the configuration screen. Yes, I know it sounds silly, but browsing the Internet shows there's a mistake, which is bypassing... 2. Read the instructions for using the FBV Express and calibrate the pedal. there is no need to d/l FBV software for this. Now. In the POD configuration screens you can have ABCD buttons as ABCD, or be FS5-FS8. This behavior is followed by four FBV switches. Okay. In ABCD mode you can:(a) choose the A, B, C or D setting from the group you are currently in. b) Insert the FX speaker and use the volume pedal... EXP2c) The introduction of another FX enabled by the finger switch and controlled by the pedal as EXP1d (by pressing the currently selected setting, i.e. the pedal which is enabled)e allows the tuner (pressing/holding the selected setting pedal)f) has the primary control of the loop, but cannot turn it on. 3/10/14 EDIT:Looper control is defective. You can record and go to debut, but you cannot record and then play/stop the loop. You can stop at the overpass, but you can't activate the loop. It seems to be a recognized and unmistakable bugNice, but if you are like me, changing the settings is much less useful than turning off FX blocks to &G off. By the way you can combine blocks such that one pedal (say) turns on the OD, and slows down the chorus &G, or turns on one amp and one (switch the channel). Yeah. You're crying, it sounds like me, so it's NOT ABCD and FS5-FS8 mode is for me!.. SO yup in FS5-8 mode you can do this, you can) turn on/off four sets of blocks using four pedals) use volume and expression options such as above (e.g. volume or wavelength, gear level, FB delay, etc.) (c) the primary ALE control shall not enable the ITEDIT 3/19/14 malfunction loop controller, as stated above, to activate the tuner? God damn it. Can't you do it? No, neither is this. In conclusion, the Express is better than nothing, but it certainly does not provide free hand desktop work. the shortboard is worth the extra, or if you are reading this before buving the cond..

"I started podcasting. I want to buy a blue Snowman blindly. I can understand why a person with a YouTube channel would like this. Perfect for dubbing. In the soundproof studio. The sound quality is good, but the room is very noisy. The ability to select four recording modes is very strong. If you want to use it. I don't want to record two people at a time. However, recording a choir or something else will work. But I'll never do that, and neither will you. This microphone has only one USB port. Not XLR. Therefore, there is no hope of expansion. If you want to host a podcast with two people, you need to throw it away and buy a mixer and two new microphones. Or you can buy 2 Audio technica ATR 2100, 1 BEHRINGER xenyx 802 dual microphone input mixer, 2 shock mount / broadcast boom combinations and 2 windscreens, raidus shock mount, pop pop pop filter and general microphone mount at the same price as the snowman.

"I bought a uke the size of an Ibanez concert. The fuselage is 2 inches wide (less than 2.75 inches specified in this support). My uke is not suitable for this stand. Why?

"I bought a small concert Ibanez with a width of less than 2.75 inches in this support. Why are you not suitable for this arena? The tuning fork of the permanent instrument is too narrow to match the curve under the brackets. Therefore, large or large concerts, so most Britons are not suitable. They find the past, but not suitable. I did. You might need this advice. Put it under the Latin American fried dough sticks. Now it's a curve, and uke. Sit better. Not good, but better. Support cannot hold all instruments, but supports full-size guitars. This pub can't accommodate most Britons, even if it's folded like Amazon video, the comments are huge. This is not a heavy booth. This is a heavy place where you can put your bag. I hope I have a small gs402b tulip corner support. All about tulip corner is a good thing. My friend has one in uke. He said it's a good thing. I don't own it, so I just give it to your car. I have other things. All Hercules are suitable for spending a few dollars. I have the support of life. No, not this. Oh, I'm dead. Anyway, it's not good. The position is not suitable for everyone. Maybe it's better to put the violin on this shelf, but I don't think its overall shape is suitable for most instruments. You might think this is a problem if you see Amazon fork. Two plastic forks, so if you expand what you want, you will change the way I don't work. It's just an imperfect design. In my opinion, your mileage is different.",2
"I bought a British sized ebanes concert. The fuselage is 2 inches wide (less than 2.75 inches defined in this support). My English is not suitable for this stand. Why? The double fork on the base is too narrow to install the instrument, and the downward bending of the support is inconsistent with this. Therefore, any scale concert or larger uke. Therefore, most Britons are not suitable. They fit well, but not exactly. I've done it. You may need this suggestion. Remove the fork at the bottom, turn it upside down, and then reinstall it (no tools required). Now the ""curve"" is upward, and Britain had better sit down. Their physical fitness has improved. Not good, but better. A single bow can't hold all instruments, but my full-size guitar bow can hold most guitars. This small stall can't accommodate most Britons. Although it folds up like a neat video in Amazon comments, it is very large. This is not a lightweight booth. absolutely. Surprisingly, it's heavy, not the one you'll pull your bag Geiger uke every day, trust me. I wish I had Hercules arch and little arch Hercules gs402b. Everything about Hercules is very good. My friend has one in the UK. He is very good (I don't have it myself, so I just show it so that you can search and comment on Amazon). I also have some things about HERC. Everything is perfect. With a few dollars, I can become a lifelong partner. This time, I'm cheap He was burned to death. In short, this small booth is not very good. One attitude is not for everyone. Maybe it's best to put the violin or other things on this shelf, but I don't think its overall shape is suitable for most instruments. You may think you can bend the fork, but it's hard to do. You need a vise. If you see a picture of Amazon, the lower fork has only two plastic slots, so if you unfold it, you should, You can change the way it is installed in the slot so that it wins. I don't work at all. This is just a design defect. My opinion is that your mileage may be different. -Bye",2
"I bought a uke for the size of Ibanez Concert. The body is two centimeters wide (less than 2.75 centimeters indicated for this base). My uke doesn't fit the bar very well. Why? The twin forks at the base that hold the instrument are both too tight, and the downward curve from the base is not suitable for this uke. So, any uke that is concert size or bigger. So, most ukes don't go well. They adapt, but not well. I did, and you will probably need this advice, remove the lower fork, flip the fork and reinstall it (no tools needed). Now the ""curve"" of it is upward, and the uke better sits on it. The shape has improved. Not great, but better. A stand can't fit all the instruments, but my natural-sized guitar can hold almost all the guitars. This little booth can't handle most ukes.

All of Hercules's things are superb, and my friend has one for his uke and says it's sublime (I don't own it, myself, so I present this only so I can search and reviews on Amazon). I have other things of Herc's, and it's all ideal, and for a few extra dollars, I could have had that position for the use of life instead of this one. Oh, well, for once I got cheap. And she burned herself for it. All in all, not well, this little booth. A booth doesn't suit everyone. Maybe a violin or something would be better on this base, but I think its general shape is less than ideal for most instruments. You may think you can bend the lower forks, but it is difficult to do, it will require a vice, and if you se e in the Amazon images, the lower fork is only found in two plastic grooves to, so if you spray out as it should be, you change the way you fit into the grooves, and so you have won; It's not working.

I remember ""humidipak"" a few years ago. They were very good to me personally. But this product is a waste to me.",2
"Maybe it does something valuable for you, but if you have one of the finer guitars this will probably do more to subtract than add to the sound. I didn't use it for a microphone where the shape of this plastic cone might do something you like when directing the sound to a microphone. As strictly a matter of natural acoustics, I found the distorted sound in a way that seemed to reduce the output and resonance of my guitar. I have an Aria AD-80, a very well-executed Chinese attempt to clone a Martin D-42. It can't compete with the real Martin, but for the money I paid it was a big buy and it's known as a ""sound canon"" for it's great natural volume. The O-Port connection broke the depth points. It just didn't bring any benefits anywhere else. However, it is quite cheap so if you have a note for nuance and you want to try it for yourself it will not break your bank. But again, if you make one of the better ones of guitar where a real person ""voice"" in his or her production process, this plastic gizmo will probably deduct from that and add nothing. I'm an acoustic nut and I'd like to have a sound port in the side of my guitar to hear everything that's going on in that box. The O-port seemed to ""corral"" the sound and to emit that plastic horn does not allow me to hear part of the resonance of the sound bouncing back and side under the sound hole. I'm sorry I'm a crab for it. I love Planet Waves and they were very good to me in the Humidity suit memory of a few years ago. But this product was a waste for me.",2
"It may be worth something to you, but if you have one of the finer guitars, it will probably do more to subtract the sound than add it. Be warned that I did not use it in front of a microphone, where perhaps the shape of this inner plastic cone could do something you like by directing the tone to a microphone. As a pure theme of natural acoustics I found that it distracted the sound in a way that seemed to reduce the output and resonance of my guitar. I have an Aria AD-80, which is a very good Chinese attempt to clone a Martin D-42. It can't compete with the real Martin, but for the money I paid, it was a big purchase and it's known as ""sound cannon"" for its large natural volumes. By adding the O-port, the depths have fallen. There was just no point anywhere else. But it's pretty cheap, so if you're a nuance nut and you want to try it for yourself, it won't break your bank. But once again, if you have one of the better brands of guitar, where a real person has it ""in tune"" in their production process, this plastic device will probably subtract from it and add nothing. I am an acoustic nut and I would like to have a sound port at the side of my guitar to hear everything, What's going on in that box. The O-Port seemed to make the sound ""corral"" and shoot out of the plastic horn, which did not allow me to hear some of the resonance of the sound bouncing back and forth from the sides below the sound box. I'm sorry I'm a crab. I like Planet Waves stuff and they were very good to me personally in the ""Humidipak"" memory a few years ago. But this product was a waste for me.",2
"It might be worth something to you, but if you have one of the best guitars, it'll probably do more to remove than add to the sound. You know, I didn't use it in front of a microphone where maybe the shape of this inner plastic cone can do something you like to direct the sound to a microphone. As a matter of physical acoustics, I found it to breed sound in a way that seems to reduce the production and resonance of my guitar. I have an Aria AD-80 which is a very well-crafted Chinese cloning attempt by Martin D-42. He can't compete with the real Martin, but for the money I paid, it was a big market, and it's known as a sonic cannon for its big physical volume. The O-Port addition froze the gaps. It just didn't add up anywhere else. It's pretty cheap, so if you're crazy about finesse and you want to try it on your own, your bank won't break. But again, if you have one of the best pieces of guitar where a real person ""expressed"" it in the process of making it, This plastic contraption will probably remove from it and add nothing. I'm an acoustic nut and I'd like to have a sonic door by my guitar to hear what's going on inside the box. O-port seemed to pick up the sound and shoot it out of the plastic horn, without allowing me to hear the sound bounce from behind and sides under the sound hole. I'm sorry I'm a crab, I like things on Planet Waves and they were very kind to me personally at the Humidipak recall a few years ago. But this product was a waste for me.",2
"Maybe it can do something valuable for you. But if you have a better guitar, it's not adding, but subtracting more in sound. I didn't use it in front of the microphone. Because the shape of the inner plastic cone will make you like to lead the sound to the miniature. As a strictly natural sage problem, I found a way to deflect sound by reducing Guitar Power and resonance. I have an aria ad-80, which is a good attempt to clone Martin d-42 in China. It can't compete with the real Martin, but I spent a lot of money on it. It is called ""possible sound"" because of its large natural volume. Low points can be reduced by increasing o-port. It offers no benefits anywhere else. But it's pretty cheap. So if you have subtle differences from nuts and you want to try yourself, it won't break your bank. But similarly, if you have a better guitar, then the real person dubs in her manufacturing process. This plastic invention will not only reduce, but will not add anything. I'm a saint. I want to hear what's going on in the box because there's a sound port next to my guitar. The o-port seems to be closed. It is emitted by a plastic speaker. The resonance reflected from the back and side of the sound hole can not be heard. I'm sorry. I'm a crab I like planetary waves In the memory of ""humidipak"" a few years ago, I personally feel very good But this product is a waste to me.",2
"It may bring you something of value, but if you have a better guitar, it can do more subtraction instead of adding sound. Please note that I didn't use it in front of the microphone because the shape of this internal plastic cone may make you like to direct sound to the microphone. As a strictly natural acoustic problem, I found that it deflects sound in a way that seems to reduce guitar output and resonance. I have an ad-80 aria, which is a good attempt to clone Martin d-42 from China. I can't compete with the real Martin, but I spent a lot of money on it because its natural volume is very high and is called ""Canon sound"". Add ports or lower low points. It does no good elsewhere. However, it is quite cheap, so if you are a subtle nut and you want to prove yourself, it won't break your bank. But again, if you have a better guitar, a real person ""bends"" in his manufacturing process, this little plastic invention can be subtracted from it without adding anything. I am a sound fan. I want to have a sound port near my guitar to listen to what is happening in the box. The o-port seems to ""capture"" the sound and emit it with a plastic horn, which makes it impossible for me to hear some resonance bouncing from the back and side of the sound hole. Sorry, I'm a crab - I like planetary waves. In the memory of ""humidipak"" a few years ago, they were very good to me personally. But this product is a waste to me.",2
"If you have a better guitar, it may add more sound than. Please note that do not use it in the front micropores, because its shape rich plastic can let you enjoy your boots. The sound on the microphone is a serious natural problem. I found that the sound on the road seems to reduce the guitar and resonance. I have an Asian ad-80, trying to copy Martin d-42 China. It can't compete because I spent a lot of money on it because it is a natural voice called canon. It's a very low voice. It doesn't do any good. However, it's quite cheap, so if you're a little different, you want to try. Your bank, but again, if you have a better guitar in his or her ""sound"" production process. I'm an artist and I want my guitar port to listen to what's in the O port box. It looks like a tape recorder, so I can't hear the back and back echoes. I'm sorry. I like wind and waves. It's good for me. But this product is my garbage.",2
"Maybe it can do something valuable for you, but if you have a guitar to make it better, it may be more a subtraction than a sound. Please note that I didn't use it in front of the microphone because the plastic inner cone in this shape may make you want to direct sound to the microphone. As a strict sense of natural phonetics, I found that it deviated from the way of sound and seemed to reduce the output and resonance of the guitar. I have aria ad-80, which is a good attempt to copy Chinese Martin d-42. It can't compete with the real Martin, but I spent a lot of money on it because of its natural size and is called ""Canon sound"". Adding an O port will lower the low point. They are of no use elsewhere. However, it's quite cheap, so if you're crazy about nuances and you want to try yourself, it won't break your bank. But, similarly, if you have a better guitar, a real ""dubbing"" person in his manufacturing process, this invention has a little plastic that can be taken from it without adding anything. I am an acoustic lover. I believe there is a sound outlet next to my guitar to listen to what happens in the box. My port seems to have a ""trap"" sound, shooting with a plastic horn, so I can't hear the sound from the holes in the back and side, and the sound bounces back to some resonance. Sorry, I'm a crab - I like planetary waves. It's very good. My personal memory in the ""wet pad"" a few years ago. But this product is a waste to me.",2
"Maybe it can do something useful for you, but if you have one of the most refined guitars, this will probably do more to subtract than add to the sound. I will inform you that I did not use it in front of a microphone where perhaps the shape of this inner plastic cone could do something that you like to direct sound to a microphone. As a matter of strictly natural acoustics, I found the deviated sound in a way that seemed to diminish the output and resonance of my guitar. I have an AD-80 which is a great Chinese attempt to clone a Martin D-42. It cannot compete with the real Martin but for the money I paid it was a great purchase and is known as a ""sound fee"" for the great natural volume. Adding the O-Port has blocked the losses. He gave no advantage anywhere else. It's still pretty cheap, so if you're a shade nut and you want to try for yourself, it won't break your bank. But once again, if you have one of the best brands of guitar where a person with a real ""expressed it"" in their production process, this plastic gizmo will probably subtract from this and add nothing. I'm an acoustic nut, and I'd love to have a sound port on the side of my guitar to hear everything that goes on inside that box.

Remember, I didn't use it in front of the microphone, where maybe the shape of this inner plastic cone can do something you like to steer sound into the microphone. As a strict problem of natural acoustics, I found that it reflects sound in a way that seems to reduce the performance and resonance of my guitar.

He can't compete with the real Martin, but the money I paid for it was a big purchase and it's known as the ""sound cannon"" for its great natural volume. Adding O-Port has clouded the bottom. It just doesn't add up anywhere else. But it's pretty cheap, so if you're into nuances and you want to try for yourself, it's not gonna break your bank. But again, if you have one of the better pieces of guitar where the real person ""announced i t"" in their production process, that plastic gadget probably takes it away from that and adds nothing. I'm an acoustic freak, and I'd like to have a soundtrack on the side of my guitar to hear everything that's going on in that box.

"I bought this brand-new musical instrument on impulse, because I couldn't ignore a manager's selection sale in a local music store. It's brand new, unopened, in a box. They allow me to check it before buying. In that environment, I think it is a good instrument. However, it is difficult to check the instruments correctly in a busy store, and that store is very busy and noisy. Only when you take it home and can check it leisurely in peace will the details stand out. This is really a six string four string piano. Its size is a little over 28 ""From top to bottom, there is baritone uke sound. I've heard of sounders and softer instruments in the same price range. Of course, the advantage of this is that it's 6-string, so if you're a guitarist, you can realize the sound and portability of the four string piano without learning new fingering... Of course, until you realize that although it has 6 strings, it's not like Ji He tunes like that. It's tuned to adgcea instead of EADGBE. People can't simply play guitar music with this instrument; all these music must be converted or learn new chord name recognition. As a novice of ukes, this was news to me until I got home and read the manual. So my main purpose of buying this guitar was to buy a small toilet The portable guitar has encountered a problem. Now this is not the end of it all, because you can be a little creative and use different chord lengths to tune it to the standard guitar tuning. This requires a little experiment, but if you don't mind buying several sets of strings and playing a mix, you can set it to the standard guitar tuning. Therefore, nothing is lost here. It's just an example Unexpected surprise - mainly because I didn't study the instrument before buying (I rarely buy on impulse) Therefore, apart from the tuning, we can understand the quality of the instrument. This is the real deficiency of Yamaha. This is an oil, not a paint or shellac finish. In some places, the oil is still visible and can be wiped off by hand. There are several small faults on the finish line out of the box. Obviously, this is an ""urgent matter"" of a factory , no work at all. No bolts; these need to be added manually (not difficult, but require additional cost and time) Of course, this action is too high. It's not surprising - in fact, it's common in ready-made string instruments, which is not surprising. But in addition to other defects in technology, it is particularly prominent here. However, what bothers me most is: if I don't know this is a Yamaha guitar... I think it's a cheap imitation of a children's guitar. This instrument One place says ""quality"" - which is very disappointing. This instrument costs about $100. This low cost is obvious. This is a ""cheap guitar"". To be honest, I can't say it's a toy, but it exudes ""beginner's instrument"" The tuner is cheap, the surface treatment is cheap, there is no decoration, there is no protective edge. The end point is - not the end point. I bought this completely based on the number of positive comments from Amazon - I respect these comments. People have different tastes, and for some people, it has a kind of ""self-control"" They'll like it. But I've been playing the guitar for ten years... Uh, I know the difference between quaint and cheap. I have two ovation guitars, a Peavey electric bass, a handmade violin and an Epiphone electric uke (the quality is so high that it's not even a game. No, I'm not Hawking Epiphone. The fact is the fact, that's all. You can read my very positive comments on Epiphone on Amazon). When I got home and looked carefully, I found that there was no sign of quality or workmanship, and there was nothing like ""it was made by manpower as cheap and fast as possible"" More telling. In fact, the only positive thing I want to say is that it does have a spruce top, and the quality of the strings is quite good. In addition to these two factors, a full-size guitar for $40-50 can be found everywhere in Amazon, which is equivalent to or better than this instrument. The only benefit this will provide is its smaller size and the sound of the four string piano Sound - if someone especially wants a cheap portable guitar tuned like a four string piano. In addition to its portability, I find it has no special advantages, even if its price is relatively low... Consider its pricing (or, more specifically, in manufacturing) People must admit that this is largely a matter of personal taste and expectations. But low quality is low quality. (editor in two weeks: I saw Cordoba in a local store today - it's a direct competitor of the instrument. Cordoba is more beautiful. It's better built, better sound and better finished products. I'm sorry, Yamaha, but the fact is the fact. If I see Cordoba and Yamaha appear side by side, I'll buy and keep Cordoba.) This is my honest comment. I know some people will disagree. But others fully understand what I mean. This is not an expensive instrument, so people really can't expect super high quality at this price. However, I paid almost the same price for my electric uke, which is of first-class quality from top to bottom. As mentioned earlier, Cordoba is a better one Fortunately, the local businessmen have a satisfactory guarantee that I can return it. Unless there is no better choice - frankly, there is a better choice, I can't recommend this tool.",2

"I purchased this musical instrument brand, with impulsive fluency for manager selection sales of local music stores I could not simply ignore. It was a brand new, unopened box. They allowed me to examine it before buying. In that environment I thought it was a good instrument. But it can be hard to properly examine the equipment of a busy store and its store is very busy and noisy. It allows you to get home and examine it in peace and quietly slowly to see more details. This is certainly a 6-string ukulele. It measures over 28 bits From the top to the bottom there is a baritone sound. I heard more mellow instruments in the same price range. Of course, it's 6 strings, so you can achieve the sound and portability of ukulele without completely learning new fingering If you're a guitar player, of course it's up to you to understand that while you have 6 strings, it's not tuned like a guitar This is a news for me until I arrived home and read instructions because it is the perfect news to the ucks, so I need to replace all these music In order to have a trap, hit the trap. Now it's not the end of things, this is a bit original and can use different string sizes to adjust this to standard guitar tuning If you buy a set and don't rejuvenate the mix, it's possible to set this to the standard guitar tuning, so it won't be lost there It becomes the quality of the instrument. It is not the lacquer or the sherar finish, and in some places oil is still visible and can be wiped by the hand It was quite obvious that this was a ""rush job"" from a factory without any work. There is no strap peg, these need to be added by hand It's not too unusual; it is not unusual; in truth, it is not quite common and is not surprising in the stringed instruments, but with the other mistakes of the skill it stands here, but what makes me most troubled: I know this This is a Yamaha guitar, I think it's a cheap knockout kid's guitar I can't say honestly it's a toy but it's a ""novice instrument.""

The only benefit that this offers is smaller size and lower Claire voice - if someone wants to adjust the inexpensive portable guitar like a Ke. Besides that portability I don't find this special Merritt to this and even its relatively cheap price However, low quality is low quality.

They allow me to check before shopping. In this case, I think this is a good tool. However, in a busy shop, it is difficult to check tools correctly, and the shop is very busy and noisy. Only when you take them home and can examine them calmly in silence will the details show up. This is a four string charm with six strings. He's a little over 28. ""From top to bottom, there is a baritone uke. The sound I heard was the same as the softer instrument. Of course, its advantage is that it has six strings, so if you are a guitarist, you can realize the sound and portability of four strings without learning new finger methods... Of course, until you realize that although she has six strings, she doesn't get along like a guitar. It is configured as adgge instead of EADGBE. People can't just play these instruments and guitars; All this music needs to be converted or learned to recognize new chords. As a novice, it was news to me until I went home to read the instructions. So I bought a guitar and a small portable guitar. I had a problem. It's not over yet, because you can use different strings a little creatively to convert it into standard guitar mode. This requires a small experiment, but if you don't mind buying a pair of strings and a mixer, you can set them to a standard guitar mode. So nothing was lost here. It was just an unexpected surprise - mainly because I didn't learn tools before buying (I rarely buy impulsively).

But I've been playing the guitar for ten years... Houston. I know the difference between old and cheap. I have two ovation guitars, one is Peavey electric beets, one is a cello and the other is Epiphone eluke (the quality is so high, not even a game. No, I'm not an eagle eye Epiphone.

However, what bothers me most, if I didn't know this was a Yamaha Guitalele... I'd say it's a cheap kiddie guitar. There's not one thing in this instrument that says ""quality""... Which is pretty disappointing. This instrument sells for about a hundred dollars. This low cost is obvious. This is a cheap guitar in every way. I can't say it's a game, but it smells like a beginner's instrument. Musicians are as cheap as they come, finishing is cheap, there is no decoration, no protective cut. The end is... incomplete. I only bought it based on the number of positive reviews here in the Amazon... And I respect those criticisms. People have different tastes and for some people has a ""home"" feeling they'll like it. Anyway, I play guitar for... Years, and I know the difference between handwriting and cheap. I've got two Ovation guitars, a Peavey electric bass, a handmade violin and an Epiphone Electricuke. (which is so high quality that it's not even a contest. And no I'm not hawking Epiphone. Facts are facts, that's all. You can read my very positive review on Epiphone o When I took this house and took a good look at it, I found no sign of quality or skill, nothing that says more than ""this was done as cheaply and as quickly as possible "" In fact, the only positive thing I have to say about this is that it has a decorative cover and the strings are pretty good quality. You can find $40-$50 full-size guitars throughout the Amazon that are equal to or better than this instrument in quality. The only benefit this will bring is the smallest size and light If one particularly wants a cheap portable guitar tuned like a wick, apart from its portability, I find no particular value in it and even in relative loss. You have to admit it's a matter of personal taste and expectation, but low quality is low quality. (Edited two weeks later: just today I saw Cordoba in a local shop-- a direct competition in this institution. Cordoba is much better, has better sound, and ends with I'm sorry Yamaha, but the facts are facts. If I had seen Cordoba and Yamaha next door, I would have bought and kept Cordoba with me.) I know some people will disagree, but others know exactly what I mean, this is not an expensive tool, so you can't expect very good quality in a However, I paid about the same price for my electric walkie and it is excellent quality from top to bottom. As mentioned, Cordoba is a better medium and costs Fortunately the local merchant has a guarantee of satisfaction and I was able to return it. I cannot propose this institution unless d",2
"I bought this new instrument on impulse. Because I can't ignore the promotion selected by the manager of a local music store. It was packed in a box and didn't fully open the new one. They allow me to check it before buying. In that environment, I think it's a good instrument. But it is difficult to check the machine accurately in a busy shop. That shop is very busy and noisy. Only when you take it home and check it leisurely and quietly can you highlight the details. This is indeed six counties and four cash. This size is over 28 sizes ""There is a male baritone uke voice from top to bottom. I have heard of sounders and softer instruments in the same price range. Of course, this has the advantage of 6 strings. If you are a guitarist, you can combine 4 Cash sounds with mobile phones without learning new methods It can be realized... Of course, there are 6 lines, but it will be adjusted to adgcea instead of EADGBE before realizing that it is not combined like guitar. People can't simply play other music with this instrument. All music must change or learn new code name recognition. UK As a novice of ES, this was a news until I went home to read the manual, so my main purpose of buying this guitar was to buy a small portable guitar. I encountered a problem, not all, because it was very creative, so I chose the road of another county. Because it can be adjusted with the standard guitar tune. Although some experiments are needed, if you can buy several sets of strings to mix, you can set it as the standard guitar tune, so everything is not lost here. It's just an unexpected happiness, mainly before I buy it Because there is no research on the instrument. (I seldom buy on impulse.) Therefore, we not only coordinate, but also understand the quality of the machine. This is the real deficiency of mach. This is not paint or insect decorative surface, but oil. In some areas, oil can still be seen, which can be wiped by hand. There are several finish lines that can be used when opening the box There is a small fault. This is an emergency document of the factory. Obviously, no work has been completed. There are no bolts; these have to be added manually. (although it is not difficult, it requires additional cost and time.) Of course, this action is too high, which is not surprising. In fact, it is common and not surprising in the already made string instruments, but in addition to other defects in technology, it is particularly prominent here, but the most painful may be playing the guitar If you don't know... I think it's a cheap imitation of children's guitar. This machine doesn't have a place that says ""quality"". It's very disappointing. The price of this instrument is about $100. This low cost is obvious. To be honest, I think it's a cheap guitar. Although it can't be said to be this toy, it exudes the flavor of a beginner's musical instrument. The color palette is cheap, the surface treatment is cheap, there is no decoration, there is no protection scope, and the end is not the end. I bought it entirely based on the number of positive comments from Amazon. I respect these comments Everyone has different characters. Some people will feel self-control and they will like it. But I have been playing the guitar for 10 years... University of Houston... I know the difference between elegance and cheapness. I have a violin and an Epiphone uke. When I went home and looked carefully, I didn't have any traces of quality and technology, and nothing could explain the problem better than ""this is made by manpower as cheap and fast as possible"". In fact, the only positive thing I want to say is that it is indeed on the top of the fir tree, Juwen The quality of the rope is quite good. In addition to these two factors, Amazon can find a full-size guitar for $40-50 everywhere. Its quality is equal to or better than this instrument, which provides the only advantage of smaller size and 4 Cash sound if someone is special If you want a cheap portable guitar, such as hi4 cash, in addition to its portability, I find that even if its price is relatively low, it has no special advantages. Its price is too high, or more specifically, it is not manufactured enough, which is a problem to a certain extent We should admit that this is a matter of people's character and expectations, but inferior quality is inferior. (2 weeks later editor: I saw Cordoba in a local store today. It's a direct competitor of musical instruments. Cordoba is more beautiful. It's better done, better sound and better finished products. Yes, Yamaha. But in fact, Cordoba and Yamaha are listed together Looks like they'll buy Cordoba.) This is my sincere comment. I know some people won't agree. Others fully understand what I mean. Because this is not an expensive organization, people really can't expect high quality at this price. However, I'm different for my electric moped. After paying the price, it is of first-class quality from top to bottom. As mentioned earlier, Cordoba is a better machine with equal cost. Fortunately, the local merchants have a satisfactory guarantee. I can return it to them. If there is no better choice, to be honest If there is a better choice, I can't recommend this tool.",2

However, I paid almost the same price for my electric uke, which is the first quality of house As mentioned earlier, Cordoba is a better tool at the same cost. Fortunately, the local dealer has a satisfactory guarantee that I can return it. I can't recommend this tool unless there is no better choice - frankly, there is a better choice.",2
"I purchased this musical instrument brand, with impulsive fluency for manager selection sales of local music stores I could not simply ignore. It was a brand new, unopened box. They allowed me to examine it before buying. In that environment I thought it was a good instrument. But it can be hard to properly examine the equipment of a busy store and its store is very busy and noisy. It allows you to get home and examine it in peace and quietly slowly to see more details. This is certainly a 6-string ukulele. It measures over 28 bits From the top to the bottom there is a baritone sound. I heard more mellow instruments in the same price range. Of course, it's 6 strings, so you can achieve the sound and portability of ukulele without completely learning new fingering If you're a guitar player, of course it's up to you to understand that while you have 6 strings, it's not tuned like a guitar This is a news for me until I arrived home and read instructions because it is the perfect news to the ucks, so I need to replace all these music In order to have a trap, hit the trap. Now it's not the end of things, this is a bit original and can use different string sizes to adjust this to standard guitar tuning If you buy a set and don't rejuvenate the mix, it's possible to set this to the standard guitar tuning, so it won't be lost there It becomes the quality of the instrument. It is not the lacquer or the sherar finish, and in some places oil is still visible and can be wiped by the hand It was quite obvious that this was a ""rush job"" from a factory without any work. There is no strap peg, these need to be added by hand It's not too unusual; it is not unusual; in truth, it is not quite common and is not surprising in the stringed instruments, but with the other mistakes of the skill it stands here, but what makes me most troubled: I know this This is a Yamaha guitar, I think it's a cheap knockout kid's guitar I can't say honestly it's a toy but it's a ""novice instrument."" The tuner is cheap as they come, finishing is cheap, but there is no decoration, no edging protection. People have different tastes and for some people this is ""homemade"" Although I feel they like me, but I'm playing the guitar... And I know the difference between taste and low I didn't find any signs of quality or skill when I got this house and looked at it. Actually, the only positive thing I have to say about it is that it has a spruce top and the string is matched Besides these two factors, one can find full size guitars from $40 to $50 on the Amazon that equalize or surpass this instrument with quality. The only benefit that this offers is smaller size and lower Claire voice - if someone wants to adjust the inexpensive portable guitar like a Ke. Besides that portability I don't find this special Merritt to this and even its relatively cheap price However, low quality is low quality. Two weeks later, I watched Cordoba in a local store: I was competing directly to this instrument I know what to do, but others know exactly what I mean. This is not an expensive instrument, so I can't really expect the finer quality at this price, but I paid for the same price for my electric woke And it's great quality from top to bottom. As mentioned above, Cordoba is a better instrument and the same cost Can't.",2
"I bought this new instrument on impulse, because I can't ignore the fact that a local music store manager chose a big sale. It is new, uncovered and packed in a box. They allow me to check before shopping. In this case, I think this is a good tool. However, in a busy shop, it is difficult to check tools correctly, and the shop is very busy and noisy. Only when you take them home and can examine them calmly in silence will the details show up. This is a four string charm with six strings. He's a little over 28. ""From top to bottom, there is a baritone uke. The sound I heard was the same as the softer instrument. Of course, its advantage is that it has six strings, so if you are a guitarist, you can realize the sound and portability of four strings without learning new finger methods... Of course, until you realize that although she has six strings, she doesn't get along like a guitar. It is configured as adgge instead of EADGBE. People can't just play these instruments and guitars; All this music needs to be converted or learned to recognize new chords. As a novice, it was news to me until I went home to read the instructions. So I bought a guitar and a small portable guitar. I had a problem. It's not over yet, because you can use different strings a little creatively to convert it into standard guitar mode. This requires a small experiment, but if you don't mind buying a pair of strings and a mixer, you can set them to a standard guitar mode. So nothing was lost here. It was just an unexpected surprise - mainly because I didn't learn tools before buying (I rarely buy impulsively). Therefore, leaving the setting without talking, we can understand the quality of the equipment. This is the real disadvantage at the foot of the mountain. This oil, instead of paint or silk, is still visible in some places and can be wiped off by hand. There are several minor faults on the finish line used to open the box. Obviously, this is an ""emergency"" of the factory and does not do any work at all. No tape; This requires manual addition (not difficult, but requires additional cost and time). Of course, this action is very high. This is not surprising - in fact, it is quite common in ready-made string instruments. But in addition to other technical defects, it is particularly prominent here. But what I'm most worried about is: if I don't know it's the lucky man's guitar at the foot of the mountain I think it's a cheap children's guitar. This tool doesn't write ""quality"" anywhere - it's very disappointing. The cost of this tool is about $100. Such a low cost is obvious. This is ""cheap guitar"". To be honest, I can't say it's a toy, but it smells like a ""novice tool"". Cheap regulator, cheap surface treatment, no decoration, no edge protection It's over. I bought it based on Amazon's positive feedback. I respect it very much. People have different tastes. For some people, this is a feeling of ""self-control"", and they will like it. But I've been playing the guitar for ten years... Houston. I know the difference between old and cheap. I have two ovation guitars, one is Peavey electric beets, one is a cello and the other is Epiphone eluke (the quality is so high, not even a game. No, I'm not an eagle eye Epiphone. The fact is, all this. You can read my very positive comments on Amazon Epiphone) When I came home and looked, I found that there was no sign of quality or technology that could explain the problem better ""This is done with the cheapest and fastest possible human resources ?? In fact, the only positive thing I want to say is that she does have a spruce tip, and the quality of the string is quite good. In addition to these two factors You can find a full-size guitar for $40-50 anywhere in Amazon. Its quality is equal to or better than this instrument. Oh, the small size and sound of four strings - if someone especially wants a cheap portable guitar, the tone is similar to four strings. Except for its portability, I find it has nothing at all Their special advantage, even if its price is relatively low... Think it's too high (or rather not enough) It must be admitted that this is largely a matter of personal taste and expectations. But poor quality is poor quality. (two weeks later, editor: today, I saw Cordoba in a local store - this is a direct competitor of this instrument. Cordoba is more beautiful. It is better built, better sounded and ready.) Duksia is better. Sorry, down the mountain, but the fact exists. If I see Cordoba and down the mountain nearby, I will buy and keep Cordoba. This is my honest comment. I know some people disagree This is not an expensive tool, so people can't expect the highest quality at this price. E the price is almost the same as mine, and the quality is first-class from top to bottom. As mentioned above, Cordoba is the best tool, and the price is the same. We have a satisfactory guarantee that I can bring it back. I can't recommend this tool unless there is a better choice - frankly, a better choice.",2
"I bought this instrument brand-new, on an impulsive whim by a management-choice sale at a local music store that I just couldn't ignore. It was brand-new, unopened, in the box. They had me look into it before I bought it. In that area, I thought it was a beautiful instrument. However, it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy shop, and that shop was very busy and noisy. It is when you get it at home and can explore it calmly and calmly that the details stand out. This is indeed a 6-string ukulele. It measures a little more than 28 ""from top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke. I've heard throat inflammation and milder instruments in the same price range. The advantage of this, of course, is that it's a 6-string, so if you're a guitarist, you can achieve the acoustic sound and portability without learning a whole new finger... That is, of course, until you realize that, although it has six strings, it is not tuned like a guitar. It is more geared to ADGCEA than to EADGBE. One cannot simply play guitar on this instrument; All this music must be converted or a new battery cord recognition must be learned. Because I was a rookie for eels, this news was for me until I got it home and read the instructions. So my primary goal to buy this... Having a small portable guitar hit a problem. That's not quite the end, because you can be a little inventive and use alternative string sizes to match this to standard guitar tuning. It takes a little experimentation, but it is possible to set this to standard guitar tuning if you don't mind buying a few string sets and playing mixup. So not everything is lost there. It was just an unexpected surprise, especially since I did not examine the instrument before buying it (it is rare that I buy impulse). So let us move on to the quality of the instrument. That's where the Yamaha is really short. This is an oil instead of a varnish or shellac finish and in different places the oil was still visible and could be wiped away by hand. There were a few malfunctions in the finish line, right out of the box. That this was an ""urgent job"" from a factory with absolutely no finish was obvious. There are no straps; which will have to be added by hand (not difficult, but extra costs and time). The action is, of course, too high. That's not unusual, it's common in hand tools and didn't come as a surprise. But along with the other failures in the completion, it was right here. But what bothers me the most is, if I didn't know this was a Yamaha Guitalele... I think it's a cheap children's guitar. There is nothing about this instrument that says'quality', which is rather disappointing. This instrument sells about $100. Those low costs are obvious. This is a ""cheap guitar"" in every respect. I can't honestly say it's a toy, but it smells like ""beginner instrument."" The tuners are as cheap as they come, the finishing is cheap, there is no decoration, no protective edges. I bought this only on the basis of the number of positive reviews here on Amazon... And I respect those evaluations. People have different tastes and for some people this has made a ""home"" feeling that they will keep. But I played guitar for (mumpely mumble) deca... Uh-huh. Years and I know the difference between weird and cheap. I own two Ovation guitars, a Peavey electric bass, a handmade violin and an Epiphone Electric uke (which is of such high quality that it's not even a match. And no, I don't sell Epiphone. Facts are facts, that's all. You can read my very positive review on the Epiphone on Amazon). When I got this house and took a good look at it, I found no sign of quality or professionalism, nothing that said more than ""this was made as cheap and as fast as possible"". The only positive thing I have to say about it is that it has a sparse top and that the strings are of reasonably good quality. Unlike those two factors, you can find $40-$50 full-size guitars anywhere in Amazon that are equal to or higher than this quality instrument. The only advantage this offers is its smaller size and opaque voice... If anyone especially wants a cheap portable guitar that is set as a uke. Apart from transferability, I find no particular value in this and not even at the relatively low price... Consider it too expensive (or rather too little made). It must be admitted that it is largely a matter of personal taste and expectation. But low quality is low quality. (Two weeks later editing: I saw the Cordoba today in a local shop-- a direct competition with this instrument. The Cordoba is much more beautiful. It is better built, has better sound, and is much better off. Sorry Yamaha, but facts are facts. Had I seen the Cordoba and Yamaha side by side, I would have bought and kept the Cordoba.) That's my honest review. I know some people disagree. But others know exactly what I mean. This is not an expensive instrument, so you really cannot expect superfine quality at this price. But- I paid about the same price for my electric blanket and it's excellent quality from top to bottom. As I said, the Cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same. Fortunately, the local merchant has a guarantee of satisfaction and I was able to return it. I can only recommend this instrument if there are no better options... And frankly, there are.",2

"I bought this new instrument on impulse. Because I can't ignore the promotion selected by the manager of a local music store. It was packed in a box and didn't fully open the new one. They allow me to check it before buying. In that environment, I think it's a good instrument. But it is difficult to check the machine accurately in a busy shop. That shop is very busy and noisy. Only when you take it home and check it leisurely and quietly can you highlight the details. This is indeed six counties and four cash. This size is over 28 sizes ""There is a male baritone uke voice from top to bottom. I have heard of sounders and softer instruments in the same price range. Of course, this has the advantage of 6 strings. If you are a guitarist, you can combine 4 Cash sounds with mobile phones without learning new methods It can be realized... Of course, there are 6 lines, but it will be adjusted to adgcea instead of EADGBE before realizing that it is not combined like guitar. People can't simply play other music with this instrument. All music must change or learn new code name recognition. UK As a novice of ES, this was a news until I went home to read the manual, so my main purpose of buying this guitar was to buy a small portable guitar. I encountered a problem, not all, because it was very creative, so I chose the road of another county. Because it can be adjusted with the standard guitar tune. Although some experiments are needed, if you can buy several sets of strings to mix, you can set it as the standard guitar tune, so everything is not lost here. It's just an unexpected happiness, mainly before I buy it Because there is no research on the instrument. (I seldom buy on impulse.) Therefore, we not only coordinate, but also understand the quality of the machine. This is the real deficiency of mach. This is not paint or insect decorative surface, but oil. In some areas, oil can still be seen, which can be wiped by hand. There are several finish lines that can be used when opening the box There is a small fault. This is an emergency document of the factory. Obviously, no work has been completed. There are no bolts; these have to be added manually. (although it is not difficult, it requires additional cost and time.) Of course, this action is too high, which is not surprising. In fact, it is common and not surprising in the already made string instruments, but in addition to other defects in technology, it is particularly prominent here, but the most painful may be playing the guitar If you don't know... I think it's a cheap imitation of children's guitar. This machine doesn't have a place that says ""quality"". It's very disappointing. The price of this instrument is about $100. This low cost is obvious. To be honest, I think it's a cheap guitar. Although it can't be said to be this toy, it exudes the flavor of a beginner's musical instrument. The color palette is cheap, the surface treatment is cheap, there is no decoration, there is no protection scope, and the end is not the end. I bought it entirely based on the number of positive comments from Amazon. I respect these comments Everyone has different characters. Some people will feel self-control and they will like it. But I have been playing the guitar for 10 years... University of Houston... I know the difference between elegance and cheapness. I have a violin and an Epiphone uke. When I went home and looked carefully, I didn't have any traces of quality and technology, and nothing could explain the problem better than ""this is made by manpower as cheap and fast as possible"". In fact, the only positive thing I want to say is that it is indeed on the top of the fir tree, Juwen The quality of the rope is quite good. In addition to these two factors, Amazon can find a full-size guitar for $40-50 everywhere. Its quality is equal to or better than this instrument, which provides the only advantage of smaller size and 4 Cash sound if someone is special If you want a cheap portable guitar, such as hi4 cash, in addition to its portability, I find that even if its price is relatively low, it has no special advantages. Its price is too high, or more specifically, it is not manufactured enough, which is a problem to a certain extent We should admit that this is a matter of people's character and expectations, but inferior quality is inferior.

It's a surprise - mainly because I haven't learned before buying an instrument (I rarely buy it impulsively) Therefore, no matter how the tuning is, we can understand the quality of the instrument.

"I bought this brand-new musical instrument on impulse, because I can't ignore the manager of a local music store who chose a big sale. This is a brand new, open, in a box. They asked me to check it before I bought it. In this environment, I think it is a good tool. However, in a crowded shop, it is difficult to check the instruments correctly because the shop is busy and noisy. The details stand out only when you take it home. You can check it quietly. This is actually six series and four series. She is a little over 28. ""From top to bottom, a baron's voice is good. I heard the safest and softest instrument in the same price range. Of course, its advantage is that it is 6 strings, so if you are a guitarist, you can get it Of course, until you realize that although he has six strings, he doesn't seem to be tuned like a guitar. He is tuned to adgcea instead of EADGBE. People can't simply play guitar music with this instrument. They have to convert all the music or learn to recognize new chord names So the main purpose of buying this guitar is to buy a small portable guitar that meets difficulties. Now it's not all, because you can be creative and use different lengths This will require some experience, but if you don't mind buying a few strings and playing a mix, you can set it to guitar level adjustment. So, there's nothing missing here. It was just an unexpected surprise - mainly because I didn't check the instrument before buying it (I rarely rush to buy it) Therefore, in addition to adjustment, we can also understand the quality of the instrument, which is what Yamaha did. It is an oil, not paint or paint. In some places, the oil is still visible and can erase the pale. This is an ""emergency"" plant that has not done any work at all; there are no suppositories; these need to be added manually (not difficult, but require additional cost and time) This is of course very high. This is not surprising. In fact, it is not surprising that this is a very common string preparation. However, among other defects, it especially appears here in this process. However, what bothers me most is: if you don't know it's Yamaha guitar. I think it's a cheap version of children's guitar. There's no place to say ""quality"" in this instrument ""This is very disappointing. This instrument is worth about $100. This low cost is obvious. This is a ""cheap guitar"". To be honest, I can't say it's a game, but it smells like a ""novice instrument"". The tuner is cheap, the surface treatment is cheap, there is no decoration and no edge protection. The end is not the end. I bought this entirely based on some positive Amazon comments - I respect them. People have different tastes. For some people, there is a feeling of ""self-control"". They will like it. But I've been playing the guitar for ten years. University of Houston I know the difference between elegance and cheapness. I have two guitars, a bass, a violin and a piano (the quality is high, so don't play. No, I'm not a nosy person. In fact, that's it. You can read my positive comments on Amazon's nosy.) When I got home, I looked carefully and found no sign of quality or workmanship, and there was nothing like ""this is the cheapest and fastest man-made"" In fact, the only positive thing I want to say is that it does have a highest spruce and a very good quality chain. In addition to these two factors, a $40-50 guitar can be found If someone especially wants to buy a cheap hand-held guitar, the only thing you can benefit from is the volume and sound of the guitar. In addition to portability, I find it has no special advantages. Even if the price is relatively low, I think it is too expensive (or not enough). I must admit that this is largely a matter of personal taste and expectations, but poor quality is poor quality. (Editor: two weeks later: I saw Cordoba in a local store today. Cordoba is a direct competitor of this instrument. Cordoba is more beautiful. It has better architecture, better appearance and better finished products. No, Yamaha, but the fact is. If you have an opinion.) If Yamaha and Cordoba appear at the same time, I will buy and keep Cordoba. This is my honest comment. I know some people will disagree. But others fully understand what I mean. This is not an expensive tool, so no one really expects very high quality at this price. I have paid not much price difference for my uke electric, which is a top-down first-class quality. As mentioned above, Cordoba tool is the best similar cost. If there is no better choice, frankly, there is a better choice, I can't recommend this tool.",2
"I bought this new instrument, on a whim, because of a sale of managers in a local music store that I just couldn't ignore. It was brand-new, locked, in a box. I was allowed to examine it before the purchase. In that environment, I thought it was a nice tool. However, it may be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy shop, and that shop was very busy and noisy. It is when you take it home and you can examine it in peace and quiet that the details stand out. This really is a six-string ukulele. It measures a little above 28 ""from top to bottom and has the sound of a uke baritone. I heard the instruments throatier and more mellow in the same price range. The advantage of this of course is the string to 6, so if you are a guitarist you can achieve ukulele sound and portability without learning completely new fingers.... This is, of course, until you realize that while it has six strings, it is not tuned like a guitar. It's tuned to ADGCEA rather than EADGBE. You cannot simply play guitar music on this instrument; all this music must be translated or new recognition of the learned string name. Being a rookie for ukes, this was news to me until I came home and read the instructions. So my main purpose in purchasing this... Have a portable guitar, hit a hitch. It's not really the end, because you can be a little inventive and use the size of the alternative strings to tune the standard guitar. It takes some experimentation, but you can set this to tune the standard guitar if someone doesn't mind buying a couple of strings and playing mixup. So everything is not lost there. It was an unexpected surprise, especially because I did not study the instrument before the purchase (it is rare that I buy impulsively). So, apart from the development, we come to the quality of the instrument. That's where Yamaha really failed. It is an oil rather than a lacquer or shellac finish and in different places the oil was still visible and could be washed away by hand. There were a couple of flaws in the ending right out of the box. That this was a ""rush job"" from a factory without a finished job was obviously obvious. There are no straps. which will require to be added by hand (not difficult, but extra costs and time). The action is obviously too high. It's not unusual. It's actually quite common in short-wire instruments, and it wasn't a surprise. But along with the other processing failures, they manifested themselves here. However, the thing that worries me the most is, if I didn't know this was a Yamaha Guitalele... I thought it was a cheap kid's guitar. There's nothing in this tool that says ""quality,"" which is pretty disappointing. This tool sells for about $100. This low cost is obvious. This is an ""economic guitar"" anyway. I can't say it's a toy, but it smells like a beginner's tool. The toners are economical as they come, the finish is economical, there is no decoration, no protective edges. The goal is... incomplete. I only bought it based on the number of positive reviews on Amazon... And I respect those reviews. People have different tastes and for some people this has a ""home made"" feeling that they will love. Anyway, I played the guitar for the deca... Uh-huh. Years and I know the difference between picturesque and economical. I own two ovation guitars, a low electric Peavey, a handcrafted violin and an electric uke Epiphone (which is of such superior quality is not even a race. And no I'm not chopping Epiphone. The facts are done, that's all. You can read my very positive review on the Epiphone on Amazon). When I came to this house and looked at it closely, I found no sign of quality or mastery, nothing that said more than ""this was done as cheaply and as quickly as possible"". In fact, the only positive thing I have to say is that it has a top of firs and the ropes are of reasonably decent quality. In addition to these two factors, you can find $40-$50 full-size guitars all over Amazon that equals or surpass this instrument in quality. The only advantage this could offer is its smallest size and ukulele voice-- if anyone particularly wants an economical portable guitar tuned like a uke. Apart from its portability, I find no particular merit in this and also at its relatively low price... Consider it overrated (or rather by-product). It must be acknowledged that these are largely personal tastes and expectations. But the quality is low. (Modifies two weeks later: I just saw Cordoba in a local store-- a competition directed to this instrument. Cordoba is much nicer. It is better built, has a better sound, and it ended much better. I'm sorry Yamaha, but the facts are done. If I had seen Cordoba and Yamaha side by side, I would have bought and kept the Cordoba.) It's my honest review. I know some people will disagree. But others know exactly what I mean. This is not an expensive tool, so you can't expect super-fine quality at this price. Anyway... I paid the same price for my electric uke and it's excellent quality from top to bottom. As mentioned, Cordoba is a better tool and costs the same. Fortunately the local merchant has a guarantee of satisfaction and I was able to return it. I simply cannot recommend this tool unless there are better options... And frankly, there are.",2
"I bought this brand-new instrument on impulse due to a sale of managers at a local music store that I just couldn't ignore. It was brand-new, closed, in the box. They allowed me to examine it before I bought it. In that environment I found a good instrument. However, it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy shop, and that the store was VERY busy and noisy. It is when you come home and you can examin e it calmly in peace and tranquility that the details stand out. This is actually a six-string ukulele. It measures a little more than 28 ""from top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke. I heard stronger and softer instruments in the same price range. The advantage of this, of course, is that it's 6 string, so if you're a guitarist you can reach ukulele sound and portability without fully learning new finger... That's clear, until you realize that, even though it has six strings, it's not tuned like a guitar. It's tuned into ADGCEA instead of EADGBE. You can't just play guitar on this instrument; All this music has to be transposed or recon learned chord name. Being a rookie in ukes, that was news to me until I got home and read the instructions. So my main goal in buying this... have a small portable guitar, have a problem. Now that's not quite the end of the thing, because you can be a little inventive and use alternate string sizes to fine-tune that to fine-tune the standard guitar tuning. It takes a little experimentation, but it is possible to set is to adjust the standard guitar if you do not mind buying a couple of strings and playing mix. Then all is not lost there. It was just an unexpected surprise, mainly because I did not search the instrument before buying (it is rare that I buy it by impulse). So by tuning in separately we get to the quality of the instrument. This is an oil instead of a shellac or shellac finish and in various places the oil was still visible and could be cleaned by hand. There were a couple of flaws in the finish straight out of the box. That this was ""rushed work"" outside a factory without any finishing work was blatantly obvious. There's no strap hangers; Those who need to be added by hand (not difficult, but extra cost and time). Action is, of course, too high. This is not uncommon, it's actually very common in off-the-shelf string instruments and came as no surprise. But along with the other failures in the workforce stood out here. However, what bothers me most is that if I wasn't aware that this is a Yamaha Guitalele... I think it's a cheap fake kid's guitar. There is nothing in this instrument that says'quality', which is quite disappointing. This instrument sells about a hundred. That low cost is obvious. This is a cheap guitar in every way. I can't honestly say it's a toy, but it smells like ""starter instrument."" The tuners are as cheap as they come, the finish is cheap, there's no decoration, no protective cut. The end is... unfinished. I just bought this based on the number of positive reviews here on Amazon... And I respect those reviews. People have different tastes and for some people it has a ""made house"" feeling that they will love. However, I have played guitar for (mumblety mumble) deca... Uh-huh. Years and I know the difference between picturesque and cheap. I have two Ovation guitars, a Peavey electric bass guitar, an on-m violin and an electric uke epiphone (which is so high quality it's not even a competition. And no I'm not selling Epiphone. Facts are on facts, that's all. You can read my very positive review on Epiphone on Amazon). When I got this house and took a good look at it, I found no sign of quality or craftsmanship, nothing that said anything more than ""it was done as cheaply and as quickly as humanly possible"". In fact, the only positive thing I have to say about it is that it has a top-notch and the strings are of fairly decent quality. In addition to these two factors, you can find $40-$50 full-size guitars throughout the Amazon that match or exceed this quality instrument. The only benefit that would offer is the smaller size and the ukulele voice... If anyone in particular wanted a cheap portable guitar tuned like a uke. Other than your portability, I find no special merit in it and even at a relatively low price... Consider it overpriced (or rather under-manufactured). It's a matter of personal taste and expectation. But low quality is low quality. (Edit two weeks later: I just saw Cordoba in a local store-- a direct competition for this instrument. Cordoba is much nicer. It is built better, it has better sound, and it ends much better. Sorry Yamaha, but facts are facts.

There were a few faults in the finish, straight from the box. Yeah. The fact that it was a ""quick job"" from a factory without a finished job was obvious. There are no tape clips; they will require adding manually (not difficult, but additional costs and time). The action is obviously too high. It's not unusual. In fact, this is quite common in secondary string instruments and was not surprising. But along with other mistakes in her performance, she stood here.

"Compared with the snarksnark sn-1 tuner, I really like the low profile of this tuner / keep it in the instrument design. The snark gooseneck breaks easily and is difficult to keep safe in the luggage bag. This works better in this regard. It is quite bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. It installs very actively and seems to feel all the strings are good. Tuning accuracy? It's hard to say - it just means high / low / on the court, really. I prefer snake's more accurate and wider scale + / 1 reading. They are more precise - they can almost be used to recite musical instruments. But this may be good enough for most people, just call in rehearsal or concert. The negative factors and the reasons why I can't recommend it are as follows. My battery cover is loose. I'm afraid the battery will fall out easily. I might stick it in place. It is not clear where the battery is placed or how to turn it on, and there is no indication in which direction the battery moves (+ I think it is upward). The second error is that once it's on your headstock, the string comment letter displays perpendicular to the user - yes, it's horizontal. On the double bass, I don't need it to tell me which string I'm playing or tuning, but I still find myself reading it with my neck sideways. If these letters were not so stylized, they wouldn't be so difficult to read, but if you turn them over, they wouldn't be readable - for me, anyway.

"Compared with the snark sn-1 tuner, I like the low profile of this tuner very much / leave it in the instrument design. The snark gooseneck is easy to break and difficult to put in a bag.

It's hard to say - it really means high / low / on the court. I prefer to read snake + / 1 more accurately and widely. They are more accurate and can almost be used to recite musical instruments. But for most people, this may be enough, just call rehearsals or concerts. The negative factors and reasons why I can't recommend it are as follows. My battery cover is loose. I'm afraid the battery can easily fall off. I might stick it in the right place. At present, it is not clear where or how the battery is started, nor in which direction the battery moves (+ I think it is upward). The second error is that once the string annotation letter appears in the pin box, it will be displayed perpendicular to the user - yes, horizontally. On the bass, I don't need it to tell myself which string is moving or tuning, but I always find myself reading it on the side of my neck. If these letters were not so stylized, they would not be so difficult to read, but if they were flipped, they would be illegible - for me, anyway. I don't understand why they designed this.",2
"Compared to the snarksnark sn-1 tunertuners I really like low attitude / leave it to the instrument design of this tuner. The snack goose neck is easily broken and hard to keep safe with a gig bag. This works very well at that point. It is pretty bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. It seems very aggressive to mount and subtle all strings. Tuning accuracy? It's hard to say - it just shows you at high / low / pitch. I prefer snark's 1 / 1 readout of a more accurate and wider scale. They are far more accurate - good enough to intonate instruments. But this is probably probably good enough to get a dial in rehearsal or gig. Negative is as follows why I can't recommend it. My battery cover fits very loose. I worry the battery will fall very easily. I may end up gluing it in place. How the battery goes and how to open it is not immediately clear and how the battery enters (e.g. I think) has no indicator. The second obstacle is that once it is on your headstock the character of the string is displayed vertically to the user - it's right, side. On the base I don't really need it to tell me what it's pulling or tuning what I'm pulling, but I still find myself tying my neck sideways to read it. If the letter was not very stylized, it would not be very hard to read, but then turn it on that side and it's just not read. I just work for my life and why they work like this.",2
"Compared with the snarksnake sn-1 modulator, I like this bass modulator very much / leave it in the tool design. The gooseneck of the projectile is easy to break and difficult to keep in the trunk. This aspect is quite good. It is quite bright and easy to see all lighting conditions. The installation is very active, and it seems that all the strings are good. Setting accuracy? It's hard to say - it's just a high / low / expression on the pitch, actually. I prefer a more accurate and wider snake + / 1 reading. They are more precise - they can almost be used to recite musical instruments. But for most people, this may be enough to call a rehearsal or concert. I can't recommend negative factors for the following reasons. My battery cover is weak. I'm afraid the battery breaks easily. I can stick it in place. It is unclear where and how the batteries are turned on, and in which direction they move (+ I think up). The second error is that once it appears on your trunk drawer, the string description letter will be displayed vertically relative to the user - to be exact, Level. On the double bass, I don't need her to point out to me what strings I pluck or tune, but I still find myself reading it on my side neck. If these letters were not so stylized, they wouldn't be so difficult to read, but if they turned over, they wouldn't read at all - for me, anyway. I just don't understand why they did it.",2
"Compared to the SnarkSnark SN-1 Tunertuners, I really like to keep the low profile /leave it on the instrument design of this tuner. The neck of the Snark goose is easily broken, and difficult to keep safe in a performance bag. This works much better in that respect. This is quite clear and easy to see in all light conditions. It runs very positively and seems to feel all the strings well. Set correction? It's hard to say, it only gives high /low /up to speed, really. I prefer the more precise and broader scale +/1-reading of the Snark. They are much more precise, almost good enough to introduce an instrument. But this is probably good enough for most, just to be called in for rehearsal or performance. The negatives and why I cannot recommend it are as follows. Mine's battery fits very loosely. I'm afraid the battery will shut down very easily. Maybe I'll stick it in its place. It is not immediately clear where the battery is going or how to op en it, and there is no indicator which way the battery is going (+ I think is up). The second error is that once it is on your headstock the string note letters are displayed perpendicular to the user, that is right, sideways. On a bass, I don't need to tell me which string I pick or tuner, but I'm still on my neck to read it. It wouldn't be so hard to read if the letters weren't so stylish, but then turn on its side, and it's just unreadable to me, anyway.

This works much better in this respect. This is quite bright and easy to see in all light conditions. It is very positive and seems to feel all strings well. Tuning accuracy? It's hard to say, it just points up/ down on the playing field, really. I prefer the more accurate and broader +/1 display of the Snark. They are much more precise, almost good enough to sound an instrument. But that's probably good enough for most people just to be logged in at the rehearsal or the gig. The negatives, and why I cannot recommend them, are as follows. The battery cover on the mine fits very easily. I'm afraid the battery's going to die very easily. Maybe I'll stick it in the end. It is not immediately clear where the battery goes or how to open it, and there is no indicator how the battery goes in (+ is up, I think). The second mistake is that as soon as it is on your header, the string titles are displayed vertically to the user, that is correct, sideways. I don't really need it on a bass to tell me which strings I pick or tune, but I'm still cracking my neck sideways to read it.

"Compared to the Snark SN-1 Tunnertuners, I really like the low profile, I leave it to the design of this coordinator's instruments. Snark's neck breaks easily, and it's hard to keep it safe in a bag. That works much better from this point of view. This is quite bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. He's climbing very positively and seems to feel all the strings fine. Measurement accuracy? It's hard to say, it just looks high, low on the field, really. I prefer the most expensive and broader scale of Snark. They're much more accurate, almost good enough to donate an organ. But that's good enough for most people, just to call the rehearsal or the concert. The downside, and why I can't suggest it, is this. The battery cover on mine matches very loosely. I'm afraid the battery will drop too easily. I might stick it in its place. It's not immediately obvious where the battery is going or how to open it, and there's no indication where the battery is going (+ it's up, I think). The second mistake is that once it's in your forehead, the letters in the string appear vertically to the user. Right, sideways. On bass, I don't need it to tell me which string I cut or string, but I find myself squeezing my neck sideways to read it. It wouldn't be so hard to read if the letters weren't so high-end, but then you turn it to its side, and it's just incomprehensible... for me, anyway.

"Compared with the snark sn-1 tuner, I really like the low profile / keeping of the tuner in the instrument design. Gooseneck snakes break easily and are difficult to keep safe in bags. It works best in this regard. It is very bright and easy to see under all lighting conditions. It is installed very actively and seems to feel that all the ropes are good. Precise tuning? It's hard to say - in fact, it just means high / low / on the court. I prefer a more accurate and wider reading + / 1 scale. They are more accurate - they can almost be used to sing musical instruments. But for most people, it may be good enough to call it a rehearsal or concert. The negative factors and reasons why I can't recommend it are as follows. My battery cover is loose. I'm afraid the battery will fall off easily. I can put it in the right place. At present, it is not clear where or how the battery is turned on, nor in which direction the battery moves (I think it is upward). The second error is that once you're on your spindle, the string comment letter displays perpendicular to the user - yes, horizontal. In the double bass, I don't need him to tell me which string I'm playing or tuning, but I still find myself reading. If these letters were not so stylized, they would not be so difficult to read, but if they were turned over, they would not be readable - for me anyway. I don't understand why they did it.",2
"Compared with sn-1 tuner, I really like the lower tuner file and provide it in instrument design. The easily broken neck is safely placed in a bag. It's good. It's very bright and easy to see every photo. It's positive and seems that everyone feels good and adjusted correctly. This means that it's just a sign when it arrives at the scene. I like wider and wider stairs and wider reading snark. They are more accurate and can almost use musical instruments. But for most people, it's good enough to just call in rehearsals or concerts. The reason I can't put forward is that my battery cover is too messy. I was afraid Carter would escape easily. I put it in the right place. I don't know where it is and how it moves, I think. The second error is that when it is in your main box, record characters to show the user's true identity. sleeping compartment I don't want it for me If these letters are not formatted, it's not difficult to read, but if you open it, it still can't read to me.

"Compared with the snarksnak sn-1 tuner, I really like this low-noise tuner, which I left in the instrument design. The hook on the goose's neck is easy to break and difficult to put in the bag. This will produce better results in this regard. It is quite bright and easy to see all lighting conditions. He is energetic and feels good to ride. Adjustment accuracy is hard to say - in fact, it's just a high / low / tone performance. I prefer a more accurate and wider range + 1 to read your snake. It's more accurate - it can almost be used to read musical instruments. But for most people, this may be enough, just invite them to rehearsals or concerts. The negative factors and the reasons why I can't recommend are as follows. My battery cover is loose. I'm afraid the battery can easily fall off. I may stick to the right place. At present, it is not clear where or how the battery operates, nor the moving direction of the battery (I think it is upward). The second error is that once completed in your headstock, the message comment string will be displayed perpendicular to the user - yes, horizontal. In the bass section, I don't need to tell me which string I'm playing or adjusting, but I still find myself reading it against my neck.

"Compared to SnarkSnark SN-1 Tunertuners, I really like the low profile / leave on the instrument drawing of this tuner. Snark's goose neck is easily broken, and hard to keep safe in a lot of concerts. It works much better that way. This is bright enough and easy to see in all lighting conditions. It mounts very positively and seems to feel all the strings well. Tuna precision? Hard to tell. It only indicates high/ low on the field, really. I prefer the most accurate and widest reading of +/1 of Snark. They're much more precise, almost good enough to tune an instrument. But that's probably enough for most, just to be called to rehearsals or concerts. The negatives and the reason why I cannot recommend them are as follows. The battery cap on the mine fits very freely. I'm afraid the battery will drop very easily. I might end up sticking it in the right place. It is not immediately obvious where the battery goes or how to open it, and there is no indicator that the way the battery enters (+ is up thinking). The second fault is that once it's on your head, the letters in the string notes are displayed perpendicular to the user. That's right, sideways. With a bass, I don't really need to tell me which rope I'm pulling or tuning, but I still find myself sticking my neck across to read it. It wouldn't be so hard to read even if the letters weren't so stylized, but then turn around on his side, and it's just unreadable to me, anyway. I just don't understand why they designed it this way.",2
"Compared to SnarkSnark SN-1 Tunertuners, I really like the low profile / leave it in the instrument design of this tuner. Snark's goose neck is easily broken, and hard to keep safe in a punching bag. This works much better in that regard. This is reasonably bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. It rises very positively and seems to feel all the strings well. Accuracy of tuning? It's hard to say, it only indicates high and low in the field, actually. I prefer Snark's more precise and broader reading. They're much more precise, almost good enough to intuit an instrument. But that's good enough for most, just to be called at rehearsal or show. The negatives, and why I can't recommend them, are the following. The battery cover on mine fits very vaguely. I'm afraid the battery will drop easily. Maybe I'll end up cheating instead. It is not immediately obvious where the battery goes or how to open it, and there is no indicator which way the battery goes in (++ is up, I think). The second failure is that once it is on your headstock the text note letters show perpendicular to the user- that is right, on the side. On a bass, I don't really need it to tell me which wire I'm ripping off or tuning, but I still find myself crouching my neck sideways to read it. It wouldn't be hard to read either if the letters weren't so stylized, but then turn them aside, and it's simply illegible to me, anyway.

"Compared to SnarkSnark SN-1 Tunertuners, I really like the low profile / leave it on the instrument design of this tuner. Snark Goose's neck is easily twisted, and it's hard to keep it safely in a concert bag. It works much better in this respect. This is quite clear and easy to see under all lighting conditions. It's climbing very positively and it seems to sense all the strings in order. Adjustment accuracy? It's hard to tell-- it just points to high low on the field, really. I prefer more precise and broader readings of +/1 from Snark. They are much more precise, almost good enough to intonalise the instrument. But I think that's enough for most people, just to get into rehearsal or a concert. The negatives and why I can't recommend them are as follows. The battery's shield on mine fits very loosely, and I'm afraid the battery's going to die soon. Maybe I'll end up gluing it to the spot. It i s not obvious where the battery is going and how to open it, and there is no indicator in which direction the battery is going (+ as with the nozzle). The second flaw is that once it's on your tombstone, the letters with a letter perpendicular to the user-- that's right, sides. On the base, I don't need him to tell me which string to pull or mood, but I'm still grabbing my neck to read it.

"Very disappointed. Epiphone left a deep impression on me, but this one didn't do it. Good manufacturing and assembly quality. Taking delivery is far less inspiring. Yes, it's a great platform, but I'm looking forward to the sound of P90. I may have received one lemon in a hundred because many people have made positive comments on it. Just not the tone and bite I expected. I can certainly invest in some puppies, but I have too much trouble with the great P90 guitar. I guess it's dice.",2

"I installed these on my Schecter C-1 Hellraiser. I have high expectations for these, but like any new over hyped technology, they don't impress me. The only thing I have to say is that it's in a good tone. But in fact, it is not much different from conventional strings. You can hardly hear the difference in parallel comparison. So now I've wasted almost twice the price in these, and it gets worse. They are not as smooth as silk as advertised. If there's anything worse than a normal string. Last but not least, they are not conducive to worry. Like a stainless steel string; Harder metals rub against nickel and wear them quickly.

But practically it is close to the regular string where the dramatic difference is. You'll be able to barely compare the differences between the lines. So now I've wasted almost twice the price on these. As advertising, they are not silky smooth feeling. If something feels worse than regular strings. Last but not least: they are bad to frets.

You'd hardly be able to hear the difference in a false comparison. So now that I've almost wasted the double price, it gets worse. They're not as soft on the side as advertised.

They did not say that if there is anything more than normal, last and unimportant, it will not cause any problems. Like stainless steel, nickel alloys wear quickly.

The quality and price seem acceptable and work well with the ball rotor. Disadvantages: it's too heavy for me to hold the microphone. I tried my arm and found it heavy and unstable. If the BOM is in a very straight position, you can, but you can't achieve the goal! The utility model relates to a clamp for fixing a base on a large and heavy support. I have great hope this time, but it doesn't work for me. He came back and ordered another rechargeable city model with a crane base.",2
"I bought this brand because I have one of their microphone supports (for iPhone) that I like very much. Pros:The clips did a good job keeping my iPad Mini without having to remove the cover of the film type (Marware Axis). The quality seems acceptable for the price, the revolving ball works well. What:It's too heavy for my microphones. I tried it on the boom arm and I made it super-heavy and unstable. If the boom is positioned vertically, that's fine, but a single shot can defeat the purpose! The clamp that holds the base of the base is large and bulky. I had high hopes for this, but it won't work for me. I returned it and ordered another CharderCity model, the one with the lever mount.",2

Update: this pedal has been returned. He went to a few concerts with me and couldn't stand life on the road. The connections inside the box loosened and became a serious problem before a few concerts... Since then, I've put my Super Overdrive back in the chain...

"I like TASCAM gear, which has been used for nearly 30 years. I'm happy to try this interface and see what it can do. Unfortunately, I'm disappointed. Although the structure and mechanical function of the device itself are good, there are still many deficiencies in the actual function of the computer. In addition, I got no manuals at all, which makes it difficult for me to understand these functions. (I'm sorry, but for such an expensive device with 2 software CDs, how difficult is it to include the complete manual on the installation CD?) It contains a very small quick start guide, which basically names the various switches, inputs and outputs, and gives very sparse instructions for using the software mixer screen. I was forced to experiment to see if I could record serious recordings in any remote way similar to multi track mode. I can't. I can record and layer multiple tracks (I was using audacity and didn't want to install Cubase), but I can't play from previous tracks, and I have real-time input. Now, this may be my computer or audacity, because it is an older Win XP machine, but it can play multiple tracks without problem. There is nothing in the mini Quick Start Guide to illustrate this, not even any hint, except to visit TASCAM's website. I'm sorry, but it's not good enough for such expensive equipment. There should be a complete manual, at least in PDF format, included in the product. If I'm going to use it for serious recording, the last thing I want to do is waste a lot of time mining information from the website, or worse, from the ""user community"" threads of some blogs. This leads to another small problem - there is no linux driver. I mainly use Linux. Only one windows machine can run software that Linux cannot run. I want to try the software under wine on Linux, but time is limited. Then there is the general problem of software interface replacing hardware. With the hardware mixer, I can access as many controls as my fingers can handle at the same time (three or four on some mixers). Computerized mixers can only do one thing at a time and must constantly move the cursor from one thing to another to access control. The controls on this interface are very complex. You must accurately position the cursor on a small part of the button to make it react. I found it very boring, and again, there are no practical instructions to help the process. It might be easier with a touch screen, but in that case, why not use buttons on a real mixer? (yes, I know. The touch screen is cool.) In addition, software based functionality is always limited by computers and operating systems, which means that everyone has a different experience - consistency is more difficult to maintain. I'm an old school person. I find the hardware mixer more sensitive and useful. I know many people are excited about installing software versions of hardware and saving space on their computers. However, I value function rather than fashion. This is my favorite TASCAM gear: it has excellent function. This software is far from meeting my expectations of TASCAM, and the lack of interface manual is unforgivable. Good mixers, especially for multichannel recording, may be complex and difficult to learn. The layers of signal interconnection may be difficult to understand at first and take some time to adapt. The old TASCAM manual actually has some guidance on multi track recording, which is very helpful for aspiring recording artists. This is not the case here.

Although the structure and mechanical function of the equipment are very good, there are still many deficiencies in the actual function of the computer. In addition, I received no manuals at all, which makes it difficult for me to understand these functions. (sorry, how difficult is it to include a complete manual on the installation CD for an expensive device with 2 software CDs?) It contains a very small quick start guide that basically gives the names of various switches, inputs and outputs, and provides very sparse instructions on using the software mixer screen. I had to do some tests and rehearsals to see if I could record serious recordings remotely in a way similar to multichannel mode. I can't make it. I can record and overlay multiple tracks (I was using audacity and didn't want to install Cubase), but I can't read them from previous tracks, and I input them in real time. This may be my computer, or it may be bold, because it is an old WinXP machine, but it can play multiple tracks without problem. There is nothing in the mini Quick Start Guide to explain this, not even a hint, except to visit the TASCAM website. Sorry, it's not good enough for such expensive equipment. The complete manual shall be included in the product, at least in PDF format. If I'm going to use it for serious recording, the last thing I want to do is waste a lot of time extracting information from the website, or worse, from the ""user community"" threads of some blogs. This leads to another small problem - there is no linux driver. I mainly use Linux. Only one windows machine can run software that Linux cannot run. I want to try out the software under wine on Linux, but the time is limited. It is a common problem that software interface replaces hardware. Using the hardware mixer, I can access any number of controls that my fingers can handle at the same time (3 or 4 on some mixers). A computer-controlled mixer can only do one thing at a time and must constantly move the cursor from one thing to another to access control. The commands on this interface are so complex that you need to place the cursor precisely on a small part of the button so that it can respond. I think it's boring. Again, there are no practical instructions to help this process. The touch screen may be simpler, but why not use this button on a real mixer? Yes, I know. The touch screen is cool. In addition, software functionality is always limited by computers and operating systems, which means that everyone has a different experience - consistency is more difficult to maintain. I am an old man. I found a more sensitive and useful hardware mixer. I know many people are excited to install software versions of hardware on their computers, save space and so on. However, I like function rather than fashion. This is the TASCAM gear I have always liked: it works well. This software is far from meeting my expectations of TASCAM, and no interface manual is unforgivable. A good mixer, especially multichannel recording, can be complex and difficult to learn. The degree of interconnection of signals may initially be difficult to understand and takes time to adapt. The old TASCAM manual actually provides some guidance for multichannel recording, which is very helpful to future recording artists. This is not the case here.

Basically there is a very small quick start guide named various switches, input, and output, giving a very sparse direction about using the software mixer screen. I was forced to trial and error about whether I can get serious recordings in something similar to multitrack modes. I couldn't. I could record and stratify multiple tracks (I was using audacity but didn't want to install Cubase), but I couldn't get playback from the previous track while I made a live input. This may have been my computer or boldness because it is an earlier winning XP machine, but it has played multiple tracks without problems. There's nothing to do with this mini QuickStart Guide to dealing with, or even one of the tips you need to look at to go to the TASCAM web site. Sorry, this is not expensive for expensive devices.

This brings me to another minor dissatisfaction - no linux driver. I use almost Linux, but there is only one windows machine that is not available on Linux. I wanted to try software on Linux, but under time constraints. There is a general problem with the software interface to replace hardware. Hardware mixer can access as many controls as my fingers can handle. A computerized mixer can do one thing at a time and one should be moving the cursor from one thing to another. The controls on this interface are very annoying, you just need to place the cursor on a very small piece of buttons to react. I had included it very boring, and again, the actual instructions were to assist the process. With touchscreen, it might be easy, but why don't you use the button in the real mixer? (yes, I know, touch screen is cool.) Also, software based features are always limited by your computer and OS, meaning it can have a different experience - consistency is very difficult to maintain. I find old school hardware mixers much more sensitive and useful. I know that many people are excited to have a software version of all computer hardware and save space. This software is much shorter than what I expect from TASCAM. There is no lack of manual for the interface. Good mixer, especially for multi track recording, can be complex and hard to learn. Layers of signal interconnection can be difficult to first understand and take some time to get comfortable. The old TASCAM manual is used to bring a constant amount of multitrack recording instructions that will actually help engaging recording artists. Not here.

There was a very small quick start guide, which basically just called the various switches, inputs and outputs, and gave extremely scattered indications about the use of the software mixer screen. I was forced to go to trial and error to se e if I could get a serious recording in something that looked like a multi-track mode. I couldn't. I could record and layer multiple tracks (I was using audacity, I didn't want to install Cubase), but I couldn't get the reproduction from previous tracks while I also had live input. This could have been my computer or audacity, as it is an old Win XP machine, but it has reproduced more tracks without any problems. There was nothing in the mini-sanding guide to deal with this, or even suggestion where you should look, besides going to Tascam's website. I'm sorry, but it's not enough with such an expensive device. There should be a complete manual, at least in pdf, included in the product. If I have to use this to make a serious recording, the last thing I want to do is waste enormous amounts of time digging up information from a website, or worse, thread ""user community"" in some blog. Which brings me to another small complaint-- no Linux drivers included. I use mainly Linux, with only one Windows machine for the software that I cannot find on Linux. I wanted to try the software under Wine on Linux but I was running out of time. Then there are the general problems with software interfaces that replace hardware. With a hardware mixer, I can access as many commands as my fingers can handle (3 or 4 on some mixers) at the same time. Computerized mixers can only do one thing at a time, and you have to constantly move the cursor from one thing to another to access controls. Controls on this interface were very difficult, and you have to place the cursor exactly on a small portion of a button to make it react. I found it very boring, and once again, no instructions were included to help with that process. With a touch screen, it might be easier, but then why not use the buttons on a real mixer in that case? (Yes, I know, the touch screens are COOL.) In addition, software-based functions are always limited by the computer and the operating system, and this means that everyone can have a different experience -coherence is much more difficult to maintain. I'm an old school, and I find hardware mixers much more reactive and useful. I know a lot of people are all excited to have software versions of hardware in their computers, and save space, etc. I value function above fashion, however, and that is what I always liked about the Tascam tool: it was extremely functional. This software is much lower than I expect from Tascam, and the lack of an interface manual is unforgivable. Great mixers, especially for multi-track recording, can be complex and difficult to learn. The layers of signal interconnection can be difficult to understand at the beginning, and it takes some time to get used to. The Tascam manuals used actually had a certa in amount of instruction in multi-track recording, which was useful for aspiring recording artists. Not here. I had really hoped to give these stars three or four, but unfortunately, the rate is only 2 (2.5 if I could) for me. Come on, Tascam, you can do better.",2
"I love Tascam equipment, and I've been using it for almost thirty years. I was excited to try this interface and see what I could do. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. While the construction and mechanical function of the device itself were good, the actual function with the computer left much to be desired. In addition, the total lack of a manual with which I have made it very difficult to understand functions. (Excuse me, but with such an expensive device that includes two software CDs, how difficult would it be to include a complete manual in the installation CD?) There was a very small start guide included, which basically just named the various switches, inputs and outputs, and gave extremely scant instructions on the use of the software mixer screen. I was forced to trial and error to se e if I could get a serious recording on anything remotely like a multi-track mode. I couldn't. I could record and multiple layer tracks (I was using Audacity, didn't want to install Cubase), but I couldn't get playback from previous tracks, while I also had live input. Now, this could have been my computer or Audacity, like an older Win XP machine, but it played back several tracks without any problem as. There was nothing in the fast start mini-guide to address this, or even hint where to look, other than to go to the Tascam website. I'm sorry, but that's not good enough with a device that expensive. A complete manual, at least in pdf, must be included with the product. If I'm gonna use this to make serious recordings, the last thing I want to do is waste huge amounts of time digging up information from a website, or worse, from ""community of users"" wires on some blog. Which brings me to another small complaint-- no Linux driver included. I use mostly Linux, with only one Windows machine for software that I can't access. I wanted to try the software under Wine on Linux, but it was under time constraints. Then there are generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware. With a hardware mixer, I can access as many controls as my fingers can handle (3 or 4 in some mixers) at the same time. Computer mixers can only do one thing at a time, and one must constantly be moving the cursor from one thing to another to access controls. The controls in this interface were very demanding, and you have to position the cursor exactly on a very small portion of a button to make it react. I found it very tedious, and again, no actual instruction was included to help with this process. With a touch screen, it might be easier, but then why not use buttons on a real mixer in this case? Yeah, I know, touch screens are cool. In addition, software-based functions are always limited by your computer and OS, and this means that everyone can have a different experience -consistency is much harder to maintain. I'm old school, and find hardware mixers much more responsive and helpful. I know that many people are all excited about having hardware software versions on their computers, and saving space etc. etc. I value the function on fashion, however, and this is what I always liked about Tascam: it was extremely functional. This software falls far short of what I expect from Tascam, and the lack of a manual for the interface is unforgivable. Good mixers, especially for multi-track recording, can be complex and difficult to learn. Signal interconnection layers can be difficult to understand at first, and it takes some time to get comfortable with. Ancient Tascam manuals actually used to have a certain amount of instruction on multi-track recording, which was useful for aspiring recording artists. Not so here. I really hoped to give these three or four stars, but unfortunately, it only ranks one 2(2.5 if I could) for me. Come on, Tascam, you can do better than that.",2

Thanks to the mixer I can access as much control as my fingers can handle (3 or 4 on some mixers) at the same time. Computer mixers can only do one thing at a time, and you have to constantly move the cursor from one thing to another to gain control access. The controls on this interface were very selective, and you have to set the cursor exactly on a very small part of the button to trigger a reaction.

"The concept of this guitar stand is great. I think it is perfect for my two TV stations... Until I put the shelf away and put the guitar in. The stand has a deep angle. As far as I know, the angle of the guitar is about 40 to 45 degrees. It looks silly, like your guitar is trying to slide out of the shelf or fall back in slow motion. It also takes up too much space in the end, because the booth must be arranged from the wall or corner to facilitate cleaning. I eventually returned these booths, but if they were made in a more upright version, I would definitely buy them again.",2

The stand has a very deep angle and the guitar was sitting about 40 to 45 degrees from what I could see. It looks silly just like your guitar is falling off the stand or falling in slow motion backward.

Besides, they're also very comfortable. The foam fits nicely around the ear, according to the contours of the face. They're regulated, so if you have a big head, you can still wear these. The only flaw I see, and I don't even consider it negative, is a twisted spinal cord. Some people won't like it. I listened to all kinds of music with them, monitored recordings with them, etc... Excellent! By the way, they're also quite good at removing foreign noises in the background, which makes the music clearer. Congratulations to Tascam for making such good headphones! These headphones stopped working after a few months of good work. I've got some low-cost patients who've been through more violence and are still working. What a disappointment!",2
"The bigger ones sometimes break their necks, so I think this may be the answer. The answer is to treat your bigger snark better, because there is no adjustment on the back of your guitar, and simple won't cut it. I had to move my guitar and stretch my neck to see the show.

"Tension screw adjustment is still the best of all capos I've used - I've tried it many times over the years. But what was ned smoking when he decided to let the trigger handle and the main support rod (including the paddle clip and tuner support) protrude from the fingerboard? It is difficult to apply and delete quickly. It visually distracts players and viewers and does not bring any mechanical benefits to the already excellent tension adjustment. The only possible reason I can think of is to use less to block the fidgety hand behind my neck - but even so, it won't fly. Regardless of the tension of capo, you should place it as close to fret as possible. Unless you avoid playing the first FRET (or use the classic FRET hand position with low thumb), you will always feel a part of capo against the leading edge of your hand. I have the old planetary wave III operation police class, and I never think this is a problem. In addition, the structure of NS artist capo is excellent. The surface is arched and the radius may be between 10-12. It is suitable for various strat fingerboards and flatter SG / LP styles. It doesn't work on my Martin OM-1's very flat 16 radius, which is almost the same as the classic OM-1. If I turn the tension of the crank, the rubber may flatten, but I don't risk damaging the neck wood. I tried pick and tuner clips, both of which are practical, but to be honest, I won't use them - it's too distracting. I just use the tuner to get the initial a, and then tune each guitar to myself or another instrument, depending on what they are. The only police station I've ever used that stands out is Kyser, whose notorious ""wrought iron fence"" design. I have one. Although the holding action is very good, I have never felt comfortable with this design. The older planetary wave capo is still available, so it can be attributed to preference.

But what was Ned's problem when he decided to remove the trigger handle and main support (including tray support and tuner support) from his fingers? Difficult to apply and delete quickly. It visually distracts the attention of players and viewers, and does not bring any mechanical advantages to the already good tension adjustment. The only possible reason I can think of is to use less to block the waving hand behind my neck - but even so, it won't fly. Regardless of the tension of the hood, you must be as close to the cargo as possible. Unless you avoid playing with the first cargo (or use the traditional cargo hand position and a low thumb), you will still feel a part of the hood close to the leading edge of your hand. I have a previous planetary wave 3 operation police course, and I never thought it was a problem. In addition, the structure of New Zealand artist Kapo is very excellent. The surface is arched with a radius of 10 to 12 and is ideal for a variety of laminates and flatter SG / LP styles. It does not apply to the very flat 16 radius of my Martin OM-1, which is almost the same as the classic OM-1. If I turn the tension of the crank, the rubber may flatten, but it won't damage the wood in the neck. I've tried picking up and tuner clips, and they're both practical, but to be honest, I don't use them - it's too distracting. I just use the tuner to get the first letter of a, and then I tune each guitar to myself or other instruments, depending on what they are. The only police station I use is Kelser, who has a famous ""wrought iron fence"". I have one. Although I wear well, I never feel comfortable with the design.

It is troublesome to apply and delete immediately. It visually distracts the player and audience, and it does not add any mechanical benefits to excellent tension adjustments already. The only possible justification I can come is to lessen fretting's hands behind the neck - but it won't even fly. Regardless of the tension of capo, you should position as close to a practical fret if you haven't played its first FRET (or if you use a low thumb classic classic FRET hand position, you're always going to feel some of the capo on the front edge of your hand) . I owned an old planet wave try action capo and didn't feel it was a problem. Otherwise, the construction of the NS artist capo is wonderful. The surface is probably arched between 10-12 radii that are fine on the various strat fingerboards as well as flat SG / LP styles. It doesn't work similarly to the very flat 16 radius of my Martin OM-1. It is possible for the rubber to be flat if I stir the tension, but I won't risk losing the neck. I tried both picks and tuner clips and they're working, but to be honest I didn't interfere either. The only other capo I used protudes so far is the Caesar in its notorious ""the Almighty fence"" design. I have one and hold as good as the action, I've never felt comfortable with the design.

The only possible reason I can think of is to use less to stop the fidgety hands behind my neck, but even so, I can't fly. Regardless of the tension of the Kapo, you should put it close to the milling cutter as soon as possible unless you avoid playing with the first milling cutter (or use a classic little finger milling cutter), otherwise you will always feel that some part of Kapo is standing in front of you.

The only possible justification I can think of is that I need to keep my hand behind my neck less... But even that doesn't fly. Regardless of the capo tension, you should be as close to the ferret as practical and, unless you avoid playing that first ferret (or use a low-thumb classic ferret hand position) you will always feel part of the capo against the front of your hand. I own the older Planet Waves three-action capo and I never felt that was a problem. Otherwise, the construction of the NS Artist Capo is great. The surface is curved, probably between a 10-12 radius that works well on different Strat finger boards and a flat SG/LP style. It doesn't work so well on the very flat 16-radius of my Martin OM-1 which is almost the same as a classic. If I could ease the tension... Is it possible that the rubber would fall flat... But I wouldn't damage the neckline. I've tried both the pick and tuner clips and they're functional, but to be honest, I wouldn't use them either. Too distracting, and I only use tuners to get a first A, and then tune each guitar to itself or to other instruments, depending on what they are.

From tarara, no useful machine has got huge tension adjustment. The only reason, I think, is to use less to stop my hand, but it won't fly.

The application is difficult and the disassembly speed is fast. It has visually distracted the attention of players and spectators, and has not brought any mechanical benefits. It has been well adjusted. The only reason I can think of this is that at least something can stop the annoying hand behind my neck - but I can't fly until then. No matter how nervous Kapo is, you should try to get close to him unless you avoid playing the first position (or with a low thumb and classic hand) Moreover, you will always feel a part of Kapo leaning against your hand.
